<br>The surge of blood through the vasculature with each cardiac cycle
is known as the pulse pressure wave or blood volume pulse. The ability
to monitor the blood volume pulse on a beat to beat basis provides a graphic
display of the dynamic activity of the cardiovascular system that can not
be obtained with an indirect measure like skin temperature.
<p>In addition to monitoring the raw PPG wave form, NeuroDyne software
routines are designed to detect the peaks and troughs of each pulse pressure
wave. Having identified an individual wave, the software calculates relative
pulse height, pulse wave rise time, and fall time. The interval between
pulse wave peaks corresponds to the inter-beat-interval of the heart (IBI).
<p>In most recording circumstances, variations in the height of the wave
(pulse height) are primarily related to changes in the relative degree
of constriction or dilation of the peripheral vasculature (discussion of
exceptions below). Increases in the height of the blood volume pulse are
generally a function of increased blood flow (vasodilatation) and decreases
correspond to decreased blood flow (vasoconstriction). The actual form
(shape) of the wave is indicative of the overall tone of the vasculature.
<p>Though not commonly encountered in clinical biofeedback monitoring situations,
changes in cardiac output can exert an influence on the height of the pulse
pressure wave. If peripheral resistance remained constant and cardiac output
increased, then pulse height would be expected to increase. Cardiac output
is a function of stroke volume X heart rate. Significant increases in cardiac
output generally occur with vigorous exercise and extreme arousal, and
decreases occur with cardiac failure. Selected readings on cardiovascular
physiology and technical aspects of PPG recording are included in the list
below.

<p>A new method for the non-invasive measurement of systemic arterial blood
pressure (BP) and its validation are described.
<br>The method combines photo-plethysmography of the radial artery with
E.C.G. - gated, rapid release (600 mm Hg/sec) of
<br>occluding counter-pressure. The release of the counter-pressure is
precisely timed with the E.C.G. signal, while
<br>photo-plethysmographic detection of the arterial refilling is used
to facilitate rapid, momentary, BP measurements. Direct
<br>photo-plethysmography of the radial artery during its reloading provides
a very clear indication of the opening pressure. The
<br>complete pressure waveform is reconstructed from multiple repetitions
of the BP measurement cycle at successively
<br>increasing time intervals relative to the E.C.G. signal. In alternative
mode of operation, the systolic and diastolic values are
<br>rapidly measured (i.e. within 2-4 cardiac cycles), at the peak and
trough of the BP wave. Blood pressure measurements by
<br>this new method were compared to sphygmomanometric measurements in
26 randomly selected subjects
