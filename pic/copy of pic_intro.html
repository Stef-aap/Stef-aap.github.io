<p><span class=rvts1>Stef's&nbsp; PIC-pages</span></p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p><span class=rvts10>Warning:</span><span class=rvts2> </span>all JAL related issues on this site, only yields for JAL v2.0 and up (and not for JAL v0.4.xx, often interpreted as JAL v4.xx)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class=rvts10>May 2006:</span><span class=rvts2> </span>currently this site is being transferred to the new JAL compiler v2.0</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class=rvts10>Stef's PIC Pages</span></p>
<p>A few of my personal links, which I need frequently.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class=rvts10>Rapid Prototyping Board</span></p>
<p>The Rapid Prototyping Board is a very universal and simple to use prototyping board for PICs, on which you can evaluate almost any PIC circuit in a few minutes. <span class=rvts10>News:</span> I'm working on a real PCB in Eagle.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class=rvts10>PIC/JAL soft/hard</span></p>
<p>Both hardware and software information about all kind of peripherals. Here also all my JAL libraries can be viewed / downloaded. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class=rvts10>PIC misc.</span></p>
<p>Some links I find interesting.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class=rvts10>JALcc Home</span></p>
<p>JALcc is a general purpose IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for technical projects, with some special tools for JAL. Due to it's complexity, it's not advised for beginners, use JALedit (thé official JAL v2 IDE) instead !!</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class=rvts10>JALss Home</span></p>
<p>JALss is a simulator for PIC and RCX. This simulator was born because I needed it, it hasn't been extended for a number of years and because of my limited time. We have had contact with the developpers of uDEV, to get a better integration with JAL, but this will need some time.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class=rvts10>PIC-RCX</span></p>
<p>Some old stuff about adding PICs to the RCX. Probably this chapter will disappear.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class=rvts10>Tools</span></p>
<p>Some tools (programmers, bootloaders, etc) for the use with PICs.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class=rvts10>JAL</span></p>
<p>Some personal notes about JAL.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Because the organization of these pages is in the hand of a machine, it's advised to use only the following redirector link:</p>

<p>have fun,</p>
