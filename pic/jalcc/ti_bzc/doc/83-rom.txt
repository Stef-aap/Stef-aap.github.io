Foreword
--------
Much heard about the idea of making a Ti-83 ROMcall reference. But no one
has made it to post one. So I thought:"Let's go for it." And here you see
the result. It's not quite finished, not even all 'documented' ROMcalls
are documented in this document... :)
I will add (and search for descriptions of) al documented ROMcalls myself,
but if you know an 'undocumented' one, please mail it to me. Or you know
how that 'strange not fully documented' one works, feel free...
(preferably in the format prescribed below)
NOTE: I'll have already had ONE reaction, about how nice it was that I
      would share my knowledge to 'the world'. BTW, I wrote this reference
      because I knew, that I knew nothing.

version history
---------------
ver 0.1   -  5-Oct-2000 - finally made entries to all ROMcalls in Ti83asm.inc
                          next thing to do: Document them all!
ver 0.1.5 - 10-Oct-2000 - about halfway, with adding documentation from
                          http://www.ti.com/calc and AsmGuru v4
ver 0.2   - 11-Oct-2000 - Finally added ALL docs, except some of those OPxTOOPy
                          and OPxEXOPy. I think I have to make some sort
                          of table for these.
                          NOTE: didn't do that because they are not after
                                each other in the ROM...
ver 0.2.1 - 12-Oct-2000 - Added some of the dozen OPxTOOPy and OPxEXOPy calls.
                          Began with adding jumptable calls. From $4000 there
                          is a jumptable, which jumps to the actual routine.
                          If it seems that all calls are pointing to the same
                          value in all ROM versions, you will be able to squeeze
                          some more speed out of your program. (17 clock less)
                          And I've heard that some calls are even jumping to
                          another call!
                          So: jump, jump, [jump,..,] routine.
ver 0.2.2 - 18-Oct-2000 - Began with adding entries from Squish.inc
                          Whowww 'thousands' of new ROMcalls!!!  yay :(
                          I'm beginning to ask why I began with this...
                          Well I'm off for holidays for a week, so some
                          time to 'recover' (Aargh, no PC/Ti for 1 week :)
                          I've decided to leave all the _CPYxx's for later...
ver 0.2.3 - 16-Nov-2000 - Thought I should release a new version, Jumps from the
                          RST's have been added, and a couple of (+-20) ROMcalls
                          from Squish.Inc
ver 0.2.4 - 16-Dec-2000 - All RST's have now a description, thanks to Assembly83!
                          I now have a document from Ti self, which describes the
                          ROMcalls in the Ti-83+, they are almost the same so
                          it is useful. (thanks to Emir Sakic giving me the URL)
                          Also began with adding entries from "ROMcalls optimised
                          by Frank Schoep - ROM version 1.07". He made a little
                          program that scans the ROM-dump for useful optimizations
                          (the ones like jump, jump, [jump,..,] routine)
                          And last but not least, I'm getting help from Assembly83
                          Thanks, you all!!!
                          I know, I know, I doing to much at the same time...
ver 0.2.5 - 23-Dec-2000 - Finished adding the entries from "ROMcalls optimised
                          by Frank Schoep". I defenitely have to mail that guy
                          to ask if I can have that program too (which makes such
                          'optimized' include-files).
                          Added again lots of ROM v1.10 'optimized' equates + new
                          ones from SQUISH.INC

                          ...
                          ...

ver ?.?.? - ??-Aug-2002 - Probably the last version, I don't think I'll go on with
                          the Ti-stuff after finishing school.
                          But you can always ask...


Format of this document
-----------------------
Each of the functions in this document has a header like the one shown below.
  (All addresses are in Hex, unless...)

The Name field holds the name of the function, and the next fields hold the
addresses to call for the different ROM versions. Sometimes some of the fields
are empty, this means the address of the function has not been found for that
ROM version. If you find it please mail me the information.

For most of the functions there will be an explanation of the function right
below the header. The explanation will normally tell you how to call this
function, what it does, and which registers it uses.

The Ti-83 ROM is located from $0000 to $7FFF, and consist of 16x16Kb ROM-Pages.
Which are swapped via port 2.
Can somebody tell me MORE about this ???
Or even make an "Ti-83 ports reference", people from the GameBoy development
Kit ( http://gbdk.sourceforge.net/ ) have asked this too.

I know that there is a new ROM version 1.1001, but I think it has only a new
number because Ti made a new case to it. I'll have to check that. (binary
compare of ROM dumps)


Questions, questions...
-----------------------
Are port 2 and 4 ("ROM page changing" and "Interrupt control") used the same
 way as on the Ti-82???
 - I've learned from ZMBOOST, that setting port 4 to 0 (xor a / out (4),a)
   doesn't freeze your calc, as on the Ti-82.
   So they are not exactly the same.

Give me some docs about the memory handling routines, _INSTERTMEMA,
_DELETEMEMA, _CREATEPICT..var..prgm.., etc.

Anyway, can somebody tell me how all the new ROMcalls in Squish.inc work?
Most of them are really new to me... :(

input: none
result: This is the place where the processor starts executing instructions,
        after it has been reseted, this is almost always because of power-
        failure, e.g. batteries taken out.
   !!!CALLING THIS ROUTINE MEANS RESETING YOUR CALC!!!
note: Although you may think your calc should be resetted by this call, it
      just simply crashes, even if no interrupt program is installed. This is
      maybe because Ti suspects that all registers are zeroed when the CPU
      is executing this code, like after a power-failure. If it isn't like
      after executing a program, this ROMcall will 'fial'...

             That particular memory address holds the first letter of
             the variable that is acting as the current input buffer.

             IE: If you're running a program, it will be the first letter
             of the program name. If you're on the homescreen, it will
             be 23h (the homescreen buffer program variable).

             Keep in mind, this value is only initialised and used as such
             during the error context, and is used if you choose the "Goto"
             option. If you're not in the error context, this value will
             be zero.

Result: A  = value unpacked from HL
destroyed: HL = changed, to allow unpacking of next number (?? HL incremented ??)
Description: Same as on the TI-82
             This function "unpacks" one number from HL. It works from right
             to left, unpacking the one-number first, then the 10-number and
             so on. It is used to convert HL into characters that can be
             displayed using the standard functions in decimal form. This
             function is used by D_HL_DECI. (_dispHL on Ti-83)
description(2): divides HL by 10 and stores the modulo in a.
NOTE: this function destroys the contents of HL.

Example:
   ld   de,StringPlace+4        ;Location to store string
   ld   b,5                     ;A word fits into 5 characters
ConvLoop:
   call UNPACK_HL               ;Unpack the next number
   add  a,'0'                   ;Now A is the CHARACTER for this value
   ld   (de),a                  ;Put that character into the string
   dec  de                      ;Point DE to the next byte in the string
   djnz ConvLoop                ;Convert all the 5 characters

description: This passes control to the TIOS error handler. The error screen
             will pop up, and it will quit to the homescreen when the user

             the error code of the error you want to trigger. You should only
             use this if the error you want to trigger does not have a direct
             access entry point.

             - Dan Englender

             Dan Englender wrote that calling this will abort your program and
             display the error screen. This may be true, but that is not really
             the purpose of the routine. You can push and pop error handlers.
             They are stored as structures on the hardware stack. When an error
             occurs, an error routine (e.g. _ERRNOTENOUGHMEM) is called. This
             routine puts an error code in the accumulator (or somewhere in
             memory, I don't remember) and calls the error handler at the top
             of the stack. This error handler can then catch the error
             (like catch in Java) or pass it on to the next error handler on
             the stack. At the bottom of the stack is the system error handler,
             and _sysErrHandler tells us where in the ROM it is. That doesn't
             mean we should ever call _sysErrHandler. (There are even floating
             point constants in the ROM that have stubs in rompage 12; just
             because we can call them doesn't make them any useful. =))

             The context you want to load should be in register A. Basically
             this is switching what "application" is currently running
             (homescreen, graph screen, stat editor, etc). I can't think
             of any instance in which you'd want to use this call from an
