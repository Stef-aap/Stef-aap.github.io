<p><span class="text-fsect">Introduction</span><br />
Welcome to <span class="bzc">BZC</span>! <span class="bzc">BZC</span> stands for <b>B</b>ASIC ASM to TI-83+ <b>Z</b>80 ASM <b>C</b>ompiler.  BASIC ASM is a new language that combines the power of Z80 assembly with the ease of BASIC through the innovative use of functions.  Available for Windows and Linux systems, <span class="bzc">BZC</span> is an excellent way to quickly learn to create high quality games and programs in Z80 assembly.<br /></p>
<p>To get started, follow the links in the sidebar.</p>
<p><span class="text-fsect">History</span><br />
Where did <span class="bzc">BZC</span> come from?  Well, Erik developed the BASIC ASM language some time ago and created a Linux and MS-DOS version of a compiler, known as <strong>Basic Z80 Compiler</strong>.  It was later renamed <strong>BASIC ASM to TI-83+ Z80 ASM Compiler</strong>. However, due to the fact that Erik used Linux as his primary operating system, he needed someone else to continue work on the MS-DOS version.  To that end, Erik posted the <a style="cursor: pointer" onclick="alert('Due to a number of reasons, support for BZC on MS-DOS systems was discontinued; in any case, MS-DOS is really, really outdated as an OS. If you\'re still using MS-DOS (in which case you wouldn\'t be reading this anyway), you really ought to upgrade!')">MS-DOS version</a> at <a href="http://www.ticalc.org" target="_blank">ticalc.org</a>, with a request for someone willing to shoulder that burden.  The file caught my (Eugene's) eye and I decided to help, signing on to the project at the end of September 2005. After reorganizing ourselves under the new company name of

At the moment, this is an alpha version of <span class="bzc">BZC</span>.</p><br />
