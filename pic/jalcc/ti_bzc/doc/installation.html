<p>Installation of <span class=bzc>BZC</span> has been streamlined so as to be as quick and easy as possible.</p>
<p><span class="text-fsect">Windows</span><br />
Simply doubleclick on <span class="asm">bzc-win32-0.1.exe</span>, and follow the onscreen directions.<br />If you have downloaded your pacakge file from ticalc.org, you first need to extract <span class="asm">bzc-win32.zip</span> to a temporary directory.
<p>Those wishing to compile <span class="bzc">BZC</span> from scratch should contact us here at <font color="#FF0000">R</font><font color="#00FF00">G</font><font color="#0000FF">B</font> <font color="#FF8800">SunSpot</font> <b>Productions</b> for instructions, for those who don't need instructions, the source files are included in the package. Just compile all the C source files together.</p>
<p><span class="text-fsect">Linux</span><br />
Simply extract <span class="asm">bzc-unix-0.1.tgz</span> to the directory of your choice. Then, switch to that directory and type:</p>
<p>
<span class="asm"><b>$</b> ./configure</span><br />
<span class="asm"><b>$</b> make</span><br /></p><p>And then, as root</p><p>
<span class="asm"><b>#</b> make install</span><br />
</p>
<p>That's it; installation is <i>that</i> simple!</p>
<p>Now continue on to the <a href="tutorial.html">BASIC ASM Tutorial <span class="bzc"></span></a> to begin to learn programming with BASIC ASM.</p>
<p><span class="text-fsect">Recompilation</span><br />
Since <span class="bzc">BZC</span> is in the public domain (and is covered by the <a href="gnugpl.html" target="mainframe">GNU General Public License</a>), it may be freely modified, recompiled, and redistributed, so long as the original authors receive credit for the original work. However, if you do wish to make modifications to <span class="bzc">BZC</span>, we ask that you contact us by <a href="credits.html#email" target="mainframe">email</a> with your suggestions, and we will more than likely include them in the next version of <span class="bzc">BZC</span>, giving you appropriate credit in the manual.</p>
