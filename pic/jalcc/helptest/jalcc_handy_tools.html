<P><SPAN class=RVTS2>Other programs</SPAN></P>
<P>Here are some other programs, I'm very satisfied about. Mostly freeware, or at least they have a free trial version. I've no affilation with any of them.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P><SPAN class=RVTS3>HardDisk Cloning</SPAN></P>
<P>Moving to a larger primary harddisk, not wanting to install everything again, I was looking for a simpel and free cloning tool. After trying 8 different programs (mostly Linux-based ;-) , of which some crashed fortunatly within a few minutes, and only a few crashed after hours, I finally found a really very simpel, fast and 15-day free trial package: Acronis TrueImage v8.0.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A class=RVTS4 href="http://www.acronis.com/">www.acronis.com</A></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P><SPAN class=RVTS2>Animation Demo</SPAN></P>
<P>Most promising programs are CamStudio (free) and Instant-Demo (300..400 Euro, free trial with AD-screen).</P>
<P>CamStudio has less (none) editing facilities. There's also a bug in the html file, which only shows up in real browsers like Mozilla.</P>
<P>Instant-Demo cann't record transparent images and is quiet expensive. The trial shows an annoying demo.</P>
<P>I now use the following scenario:</P>
<UL style="text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 24px; list-style:outside;">
<LI>ONLY if you want to record TRANSPARENT objects, make a recording with CamStudio (Pause/Continue = F1). Instant-Demo doesn't record transparent objects. So if you want to record transparent objects, first make a recording with CamStudio, then while reviewing it, record it with Instant-Demo.</LI>
<LI>record the demo with Instant-Demo (Pause/Continue = Pause).&nbsp;</LI>
<LI>Edit the recording with Instant-Demo. After Inserting text balloons, the time of that frame is enlarged from 10 or so to 300 (about 3 seconds). So decrease that time again and span the balloon tip over a number of frames.</LI>
<LI>Make a recognizable start and end frame with a large period time.</LI>
<LI>Now review the the recording (starting at the wanted start-frame) and record the recording with CamStudio, because in the review mode of Instant-Demo, there's no AD-message !!&nbsp; (AVI-recording gives the most possibilities, using SWF does also record in AVI-mode, but throws it automatically away).</LI>
<LI>Convert the recording from AVI to SWF or some other convenient format.</LI>
<LI>Edit the generated html file, because height and width are not correctly inserted.</LI>
</UL>
