<P><SPAN class=RVTS3>Why doesn't the program ask if it has to save a modified file ?</SPAN></P>
<P>The program is based on minimal user interaction. In 99% of the cases most of the people always want to save their changes.</P>
<P>There are also a number of actions (e.g. compiling of code with macros), that needs to be saved before the real action takes place.</P>
<P>Another reason is that each modfied document is saved at regular intervals.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P><SPAN class=RVTS3>If I change the readonly flag in a editor window, why isn't this reflected in the document list ?</SPAN></P>
<P>There are several reasons for this behaviour, first of all when a file is launched from the document list, the coupling between document list and editor is lost (I've seen document list with over 20,000 items (my own ;-), so it'ld take too much time to enumerate the whole document list. Secondly you could decid to make 2 branches with the same documents, one in readonly style, the other in editable style.</P>
