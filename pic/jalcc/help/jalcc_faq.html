<p><span class=rvts3>Why doesn't the program ask if it has to save a modified file ?</span></p>
<p>The program is based on minimal user interaction. In 99% of the cases most of the people always want to save their changes.</p>
<p>There are also a number of actions (e.g. compiling of code with macros), that needs to be saved before the real action takes place.</p>
<p>Another reason is that each modified document is saved at regular intervals.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p><span class=rvts3>If I change the read-only flag in a editor window, why isn't this reflected in the document list ?</span></p>
<p>There are several reasons for this behavior, first of all when a file is launched from the document list, the coupling between document list and editor is lost (I've seen document list with over 20,000 items (my own ;-), so it would take too much time to enumerate the whole document list. Secondly you could decide to make 2 branches with the same documents, one in read-only style, the other in edit-able style.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class=rvts3>How do I create a new document ?</span></p>
<p>Select a document in the document (preferable in the directory where you want to put the new document), press the INS button (or select from the right mouse menu), and a new entry will be put in the document list. After opening the document, it will be created.</p>
<p>Especially with programs, you might follow a different way. Save an existing with "Save as", now the file will really be created and it will be put in the document list, just above the selected item.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class=rvts3>Will it remain free ?</span></p>
<p>Yes, it's a hobby project and I just use it myself as a tool to earn money.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class=rvts3>Can I get the sources ?</span></p>
<p>No, due to my bad experience in the past, when I also published the sources. It costed me a lot of time helping other developers, and I've never seen any positive result, except for JALedit.</p>
