<P><SPAN class=RVTS2>Introduction</SPAN></P>
<P>JALss is basically a simple logic simulator, with some restricted possibilities to simulate analog signals.</P>
<P>It doesn't simulate high resolution time simulation, so for instance rise and fall times of digital signals is not taken into account.</P>
<P>Because all devices will be run from the same master clock, low resolution timing aspects are included (all devices know the frequency of the master clock).</P>
<P>All devices are operated in a full clock synchronuous mode, and are controlled by the same master clock.</P>
<P>Therefor every device has 2 execution phases:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. execute_1 :&nbsp; reading of the inputs (while maintaining the outputs untouched)</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. execute_2 :&nbsp; generating the output, based on the previous fetched input signals</P>
<P>Functional behaviour of a device can be implemented in one of the two execution phases.</P>
<P>To improve simulation speed, there are 2 execution list: a fast execution list and a slow execution list. The speed ratio of the 2 execution lists can be set by the user and is known to all device. Each device is added to one of these lists and it will informed on which list it resides.</P>
<P>There is a third execution list, called static list, which is only executed once after a general reset.</P>

<SPAN class=RVTS2>Basic Outlines&nbsp;</SPAN><IMG width=14 height=14 src="top_page.gif"></P>
<P>Device = an object of which the most important properties are IO-pins and an execute methode</P>
<P>PIC = just a device + as major extra feature that the internal registers are accesible (but maybe that should also yield for some other devices ?)</P>
<P>SCOPE = a device + as major extra feature that it can connect not only to single IO-pins, but also to (nibbles), bytes and words (maybe this should also yields for some other devices ?)</P>
<P>MAIN PROGRAM : connects all the devices together and calls the execute methods off all devices</P>
<P>EXECUTE&nbsp; method, to resolve problems in the ordering of the calculations of the different devices, 2 phases are introduces</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; execute_1 = read the input pins, calculate (but not connect to the output pins) the result</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; execute_2 = transport the result to the output pins</P>
<P>SPEED, to optimize speed the following features are implemented</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. the mainprogram will implement 2 execution lists, one list that will execute always and one that will execute sometimes</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. devices that use intensive graphical procedures (or other time consuming actions) should implement 2 execute methodes fast and slow.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The control of fast / slow must be possible from within the mainprogram</P>
<P>ERRORS, devices should get a possibility to report errors (executing errors, not connected input pins, ...)</P>
<P>SETTINGS, devices should get a possibility to easy store their settings through the mainprogram</P>

<P>At first sight it seems logical to use Tcomponent as the baseclass, but besides the owner it doesn't add much necessary functionality. (name for instance must be a valid Delphi name and for this purpose a user name (possible with spaces) is wanted).</P>
