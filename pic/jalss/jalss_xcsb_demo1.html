<P><SPAN class=RVTS2>This example shows a simulation of an XCSB program.</SPAN></P>
<P>The program counts form 0 to 9 and round again. The number is increased every 250 msec, for which the multi-tasking feature of XCSB is used.&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the figure 4 is displayed, the inline breakpoint=4 (see program listing) halts the simulation, as shown in the picture below. In the lower-right corner of the PIC device you can see the number of the breakpoint that stopped the simulation.</P>
<P>On the "stack page" you can see the actual values of a PIC register (PORTB) and a user variable (AAP1). The user variable will be tracked, even if it's moved by a new compilation. Both bytes are shown in hexadecimal value and binary value (to get a binary representation, place a minus sign before the variable name).</P>
<P>The pull downed menus shows the available user variables in the current program.</P>
<P>At the right top a special device is shown, "byte LED-bar", with one press on the input pins, it can be connected to a complete byte. This byte may even be an internal register of a PIC or even a user variable of the program loaded into the PIC.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>Here is the used XCSB code (presented in JALcc).</P>
<P>If you never have used JALss, you may notice that the filename has the extension ".XCB".</P>
<P>Sergio Masci (the creator / owner of XCSB) has reserved this extension special for this purpose, because I had reserved ".BAS" already for something else. The included file should have also had the extension ".XCB", this works now but I forgot to change it before shooting this picture.</P>
