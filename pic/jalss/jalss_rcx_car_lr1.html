<P>This device simulates an RCX with a left and right motor, driving around in a room. It has 2 front bumpers and 2 rear bumpers.&nbsp;</P>
<P>By connecting the 2 motors to the virtual RCX, the car can be controlled by the virtual RCX, which can be controlled by a program or directly by the tools of Bricxcc.</P>
<P>When one of it bumpers touches a wall, the corresponding ligth will color red and a resistor is connected to ground (you can edit the value of each resistor). By connecting the bumper outputs to the sensor inputs of the virtual RCX, you can test a program running in the virtual RCX.</P>
<P>Also the motors will draw more power, which can be seen in the internal motor signals of the viryual RCX.</P>
<P>With the sliders Xpos, Ypos and Angle you can set the initial and current location and orientation of the car.</P>
<P>With the Scale slider you can scale the RCX to get a bigger or smaller room.</P>
<P>The color of the background can be changed by clicking with the right-mouse button on the background. You can change the image of the car by substituting another image for "rcx5.bmp" (in the main JALss directory)</P>
<P>Help button, shows this page.</P>
<P>RST button does nothing at the moment.</P></TD>

<P>Technical:</P>
<P>This device is totally programmed as a DLL. You can find the Delphi source code here:&nbsp;&nbsp;<A class=RVTS4 href="../download/jalss/dll_dev_rcx_car_lr.pas">DLL_dev_RCX_car_LR.pas</A>&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp;<A class=RVTS4 href="../download/jalss/dll_dev_rcx_car_lr.dfm">DLL_dev_RCX_car_LR.dfm</A></P>
<P>Normal motor resistance is 80 Ohm, when bumping the resistance drops to 50 Ohm.</P></TD>
