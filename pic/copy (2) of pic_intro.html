<P><SPAN class=RVTS1>Stef's&nbsp; PIC-pages</SPAN></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>My PIC pages are on the air again. All beautiful colors are lost,&nbsp;
but accessibility is improved and website management is peanuts now.
According to my html-cleaner, there are zero broken internal-links now.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>I hope these pages might be of interest to many people, 
although this is not the primary goal. 
The primary goal is ofcourse my PIC (Personal Information Cabinet), 
therefore some pages may be very cryptic.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>Looking at the tree on the left, above and below the first branch are expanded by default. 
I'll use above the first branch for new / interesting announcements, 
and I'll use the expanded first branch for my own personal interest.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>Because the organization of these pages is in the hand of a machine, 
it's advised to use only the following redirector link:</P> 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://pic.flappie.nl">http://pic.flappie.nl</a></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>have fun,</P>
<P>Stef Mientki</P>
