<p>ABSTRACT
<p>The basic elements of a fairly complete optomechanical kit based on
the use of LEGOa is presented. Through a careful exploitation of the many
standard LEGO elements, and adding a few new simple components made of
plexiglass, we demonstrate that almost all of the mechanical parts of an
optical setup can be built with little effort and at an extremely reduced
cost. Several systems and experiments are presented, mainly in the fields
of optical filtering and interferometry, to show that the proposed mountings
are perfectly suitable for didactic purposes, and can often be employed
even in more demanding scientific applications. Keywords: Education in
optics, optical mounts, modular systems.
<p>1. INTRODUCTION
<p>In professional optical equipments, mechanical components make up a
sizeable part in terms of cost, weight and size. On the other side, consumer
systems are increasingly relying on plastics to replace metal parts; there
is even a well established trend towards replacing glass with high-quality
transparent polymers in aspherical optical elements. In a laboratory setup
for educational purposes (or even for research) low cost, reduced weight
and compact size are all desirable characteristics. Versatility, quickness
and ease of assembly are also extremely valuable. Commercial opto-mechanical
components are still very far from representing a true achievement of such
goals. In recent years a few companies have developed new products with
these features in mind, some of them specifically devised for educational
purposes. Even though weight, size and ease of use have been enhanced with
respect to conventional optical mountings, costs are still high, and a
few drops of adhesive or small pieces of plastic putty are still often
required to adjust the various components to the experimenter’ s needs.
In this communication we suggest the use of LEGO for educational-, or even
research-grade optical mountings. LEGO is a highly modular construction
system in which simple pieces (bricks, rods, beams, axles, gears, plates,
hinges and so on) can be connected by means of the well-known (and patented)
stud-and-tube coupling; the bricks and other shapes are moulded in ABS
(acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) and the geometrical tolerances applied
in the production process are quite tight: no more than two hundreds of
mm from the nominal shape and size. As a consequence, the force needed
to separate two elements reaches the remarkable figure of about 1.5-3.5
N for each stud-tube unit so that extremely large and complex structures,
made up of fixed as well as of moving parts, can be safely assembled. The
use of LEGO in scientific and technical education programs is not new,
LEGO DACTA products being already mainly designed for didactic aims. With
some modifications of the hundreds of standard LEGO elements, mainly of
the TECHNIC series, and the introduction of a few home-made components,
we have set up all of the basic opto-mechanical devices: holders, translation
and rotation stages, xyz positioners, tilters, laboratory jacks, not to
mention posts, bases, rails, and breadboards, that are all standard LEGO
components. With these elements we have been able to build several instruments
and systems, like microscopes and interferometers, demostrating the feasibility
of using LEGO even in setups where a high degree of stability is required.
<p>2. BASIC ELEMENTS
<p>Some of the basic components of an optomechanical setup, like tilters
and rotators, are already included, although usually in a very raw version,
in commercially available LEGO kits. These elements can be used directly,
without any modification, and are found to be suitable for static mountings,
where the position is adjusted once and for all during the alignement phase.
As for the realization of moving parts (such as translators), one has available
off the shelf screws, gears, rails, tracks and other simple pieces with
which even considerably complicated setups can be assembled. Just to have
an idea of the level of sophistication that can be reached, we like to
mention that a complete kit for building a full functioning plotter has
been available for some time. The main drawback in building moving parts
from standard LEGO elements is often the considerable size of the resulting
assembly, and the consequent lack of mechanical stability that may result;
again, this is not a serious problem when one wants to build components
that are not meant to be adjusted continuously during the experiment: even
complicated and bulky structures have been realized resorting to standard
pieces only, such as for example a laboratory jack able to support a medium-power
He-Ne laser tube. Lens and cube-splitter holders have also been constructed
from the small beams and axles of various shapes that can be found in any
LEGO kit and have shown remarkable characteristics, particularly as far
as the ease of assembly and positioning is concerned; under this respect,
they are even better than the usual mountings found in any optics lab,
because the great number of different elements available in a LEGO box
far surpasses that of any “professional” kit, making for instance the task
of adjusting the height of the various components of an optical setup an
easy one; anyone who has been struggling with this trivial but extremely
annoying problem will be pleased to see that it can be solved with such
a little effort, and with no severe reduction in the mechanical stability
of the setup. Of course, in some cases standard beams and axles simply
won’ t work properly, and that’ s why we have devised some custom components,
sometimes resulting from a simple modification of existing ones and sometimes
designed from scratch keeping in mind the existing realizations; in doing
so, we have exploited the original LEGO material as far as possible, keeping
the number of new parts at a minimum. As we wanted to keep as consistent
an approach as possible to our goal of using only modular, easy-to-assemble
plastic elements for our mountings, all custom pieces and components were
machined from solid plexiglass; among these new elements we mention for
instance the rods that guide the springs in our home-designed positioning
stages, the precision screws that we use to impart a finely controllable
motion to the moving parts, and the threaded adapters designed to hold
in place microscope objectives. The mechanical characteristics of plexiglass
are homogeneous with those exhibited by the ABS plastic LEGO is made from.
We have as well avoided using particularly sophisticated designs: all the
components can be easily machined in any mechanical shop with little effort.
Should an interest arise in the scientific and teaching community, we deem
that it would be perfectly feasible for the manufacturers of LEGO to produce
most of these new components themselves. In the following we briefly describe
some of the optomechanical devices that have been built, emphasizing the
relevant constructive details of each of them; to keep things a little
systematic, we divide the components into four basic categories: holders
and adapters, translation stages, rotators, and tilters.
<p>2.1. Holders and adapters
<p>Several different components have been realized to perform the basic
task of keeping optical elements firmly in place. The basic component is
the lens holder (figure 1), which can also be used with filters, polarizers,
pinholes and all geometrically adaptable elements; the stability provided
by this simple assembly is quite good, so that it can be used to replace
more conventional (that is, metal-made) holders in a large variety of applications.
The same holds for the beam-splitter table illustrated in figure 2. A more
refined component is the self-centering holder shown in figure 3; we emphasize
that only standard LEGO elements were used here, with hinges fixed to the
three rods that make up the triangular frame and three spring-loaded axles
pushing on the edge of the lens (or whatever optical components one needs
to use). The resulting structure is remarkably stable, and again it can
provide a viable alternative to standard three-point mounts. Threaded pieces
suitable to be matched to optical components like microscope objectives
are not included in LEGO kits; one may think of machining the LEGO elements
directly, but this is not feasible in this case: a much better solution
is to obtain the threaded ring from a piece of plexiglass and then sandwich
this adapter between two LEGO bases, to obtain a compact and at the same
time stable assembly. A microscope objective adapter with standard microscope
thread is shown in figure 4.
<p>2.2. Translation stages
<p>The basic design of a linear positioning stage is clearly recognizable
in figure 5. In building this fundamental component we took advantage of
the availability of a LEGO TECHNIC element which has basically the shape
of a rectangular beam and carries a series of transversal holes through
which circular rods and screws can be passed. One of the holes must be
threaded to fit the precision screw (M6&acute;0.5) through which we impart
the motion; we point out that in this case, thanks to the particular design
of this element, the thread is machined in the thickness of the walls of
the hole, so that no plexiglass adapter is required. We have built several
stages, each characterized by its own peculiar dimensions and by the different
technical solutions exploited in their design: sometimes the loading is
provided by small springs, while in other cases we have tried the use of
rubber bands; the lateral rods have been either taken from standard LEGO
kits or built from plexiglass, which seems to be a better choice (the section
of the LEGO axles is not suitable to achieve a precise guiding of the moving
part of the stage). Two- and three axis positioning stages (figure 6) have
been constructed by simply putting together two or three linear positioners;
the resulting assembly looks rather awkward but works just fine, enough
to allow the realization of a low-pass filtered beam expander that we shall
examine later. Among the main problems encountered we have to mention the
difficulty in obtaining a truly linear motion; to improve this important
point we think that a different section for the lateral rods should be
exploited. Among the translation stages we may also include the laboratory
jack of figure 7. As can be seen the component can easily carry a considerable
load and provides a large vertical adjustment range; it is better either
to fix it to a breadboard (a LEGO base plate) or to put some weight on
its base, because in spite of its size the assembly is pretty light and
may be unstable when carrying a heavy object.
<p>2.3. Rotators
<p>While linear positioning stages are relatively easy to design and to
build, rotators do not lend themselves to the same kind of approach based
on the principle of making only the slightest possible modifications to
existing LEGO elements. In fact, even though some very raw rotating components
exist in the LEGO gallery, they are unsuitable for precision work and have
to be replaced with better designed ones. A picture of our rotator is reproduced
in figure 8. The body of the component is made up of a plexiglass ring
through which an off-axis hole is pierced; the top and bottom plates are
obtained from a suitably cut LEGO sheet, and the motion is given by a precision
screw that pushes a small cam glued to one of the bases (the other can
be blocked by means of another screw). A small spring provides the necessary
loading. The device works properly only for small angular displacements
(as any rotator based on this kind of mechanical design does) and is a
bit hard to build.
<p>2.4. Tilters
<p>We have developed essentially only one kind of tilter, based on a simple
design, which has proved to provide very interesting performances. The
mechanical assembly, shown in figure 9, is made up of two L-shaped structures
made from LEGO plates, hinged by means of a small steel sphere and connected
by plexiglass precision screws; the loading is provided either by springs
or rubber bands as in the case of the translation stages. The mirror is
glued on a tiny LEGO interfacing element and clutched at the corner of
the “L”, on axis with the sphere. The assembly provides very accurate tilts
thanks to its compact and tight design and to the considerable lever arm
from the screws to the mirror. An extremely simple tilter can be constructed
also by connecting together two hinges (or two hinged tables).
<p>3. LABORATORY SETUPS
<p>One of the first thing that is needed when building an optical setup
is a breadboard; LEGO provides several plates of different size, up to
38&acute;38 cm2 (48&acute;48 studs), that can easily accommodate even complicated
systems, with the advantage that you won’ t have to worry about metric
or English hole patterns. Naturally, the stability of a LEGO base is nowhere
close to that of a true breadboard, so precautions have to be taken to
avoid bending; the easiest way to do this is to provide a hard flat surface
to support the base: a reasonably good tabletop will usually do, and we
have performed most of our experiments on a common office desk. The square
pattern formed by the studs puts some geometrical constraints on the geometry
of the setups that can be fastened to the surface of the base plate; if
one were to connect bricks and beams directly to the base then only right
angles could be obtained, but luckily this severe limitation can be easily
overcome by using 1-stud bricks as posts. In this way, several directions
can be chosen, forming different angles with the sides of the base plate;
there are some angles and distances for which the linear elements fit perfectly
in place, and others that are close enough to this matching condition that
the fit can be obtained anyway, relying on a slight deformation of the
pieces and the plate itself. We however emphasize that every time we have
an imperfect match, tensions develop in the mounts and the whole assembly
becomes less stable. Several optical instruments and systems have been
mounted on our LEGO breadboard, and several experiments performed to show
how an educational optics lab can take advantage of the proposed systems.
One of the first instruments that were built was a microscope; the body
of the instrument is made up of four plexiglas rods connecting two square
bases 150 mm apart, and a cardboard tube to shield the collected rays’
path from ambient light. One of the two bases carries the objective and
the other has a CCD camera mounted on it; as we image though a CCD, no
eyepiece is needed. Figure 10 shows the microscope looking at the LEGO
base plate, with the image of a stud forming on the monitor. The microscope
was used both in transmitted and in reflected light; in the former case
the sample was illuminated by a LED. A dark ground configuration was also
realized stopping the central portion of the transmitted light in the Fourier
plane; the result of this simple but educationally meaningful experiment
is shown in figure 11. Many more optical filtering experiments were performed
with the setup illustrated in figure 12 ; the critical component here is
the xyz stage, made up of three linear positioners as described before,
which carries the filter. In the simplest case (Schlieren filtering) the
filter is just the edge of a small LEGO plate (one of the thin, smooth
ones); putting two of these plates close to each other one obtains a slit
that can be used, for example, to perform the Abbe-Porter experiment shown
in figure 13. If one needs an adjustable slit, a lens holder of the type
described above can be employed to keep it in place. A thin wire fixed
to the xyz stage provides an easy means to realize a high-pass filter like
that used in the well-known wire test. One of the most useful components
realized is the beam expander and low-pass filter of figure 14; in this
case the xyz positioner carries a 50 mm pinhole that has to be adjusted
in the focal plane of the microscope objective (10&acute; magnification).
The quality of the beam leaving the expander is quite good. Interferometers
are undoubtedly among the most useful and instructive optical systems.
One often thinks that, due to the small wavelength of light, an interferometer
must be built with extremely demanding tolerances and so may be led to
reject the use of plastics in such an instrument as complete nonsense.
We show here that, despite the relatively coarse positioning capabilities
of our translators and tilters, most interferometric configurations can
be realized using LEGO elements as building blocks. The best known interferometer
is probably that of Michelson, and so we decided to start with it (for
the sake of precision the interferometer that we built is better identified
as a Twyman-Green, which is just a Michelson working in collimated light);
the source was a red diode laser of poor coherence, so that the path difference
between the two arms of the interferometer had to be closely matched; to
this aim, one of the tilters was mounted on top of a linear positioning
stage, thus adding the possibility of working in white light. The fringes,
after passing through a magnifying objective, were projected on a screen.
Figure 15 shows the straight fringes obtained after the alignement procedure,
that took about 5 minutes. Encouraged by the relative ease with which we
could see the fringes in the Michelson we decided to build also a Mach-Zender.
The source was a He-Ne as in the optical filtering experiments, so that
we were free to choose the length of the two arms according to our needs.
In this case the laser beam was expanded before entering the interferometer,
and the fringes were both projected on a rotating ground glass imaged by
a compact CCD camera and, by addition of a magnifying lens, on a white
screen for direct inspection. This is probably the most complicated system
that we have built thus far, and the aligning procedure was a bit more
time-consuming. Anyway, the results are remarkably good, as shown in figure
16 and there are no serious problems as far as the stability of the fringes
is concerned.
<p>4. CONCLUSIONS
<p>The feasibility of using LEGO for optical mounts has been demonstrated.
The versatility of the LEGO system and the ease with which even complicated
components and setups can be realized is sometimes almost astonishing.
Fixed elements like holders and posts are those that present the least
problems; under this respect, the objects presented in this communication
can often replace heavier, bulkier and much more expensive “professional”
components without affecting the performances of highly sensitive systems
like interferometers. Moving parts are more critical because the mechanical
tolerances with which LEGO is produced are not thought with scientific
applications in mind. Nevertheless, resorting to some custom elements appropriately
designed we have been able to build positioning stages, rotators and tilters
whose accuracy and reliability are sufficient for realizing quite complicated
experiments in interferometry, microscopy and Fourier optics, with an enormous
advantage in terms of costs and, we believe, with more fun for the young
student who is confronted with optical setups for the first time. We finally
emphasize that the results presented here suggest that an integration between
LEGO and conventional optomechanical elements made of aluminum or steel
is indeed possible and that plastic-made components often exhibit adequate
characteristics in terms of positioning accuracy and stability, to the
point that they can successfully replace metallic mounts at a tiny fraction
of the cost of the latter. If some more research were carried out, working
on the most promising mechanical configuration, devising some new cleverly
designed elements and maybe trying different polymers, LEGO may soon make
its appearance on many optical benches.
