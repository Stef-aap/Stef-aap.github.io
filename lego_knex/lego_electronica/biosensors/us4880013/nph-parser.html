<BR><CENTER><B>Abstract</B></CENTER>
<P>A method is disclosed for determining the blood pressure of a patient. The
     method includes the steps of affixing a non-invasive pressure inducing
     device and transducer to the patient. A data stream is obtained from the
     transducer. The data stream includes pressure data and pulsation signal
     data. The data stream is processed to create an information stream which
     correlates the pressure data and the pulsation signal data. The
     information stream includes at least two pulse maximum points and at least
     one pulse minimum point. At least one of the systolic, diastolic and mean
     arterial pressures of the patient are determined by choosing a pressure
     determination point in the information stream between the two pulse
     maximum points. Additionally, an apparatus for determining blood pressure
     is disclosed.

<HR>
<BR><BR>What is claimed is:
<BR><BR>1. A method of determining blood pressure of a patient comprising the steps
     of:
<BR><BR>a. affixing a non-invasive pressure inducing means and transducer means to
     the patient,
<BR><BR>b. elevating the pressure induced by the pressure inducing means to a
     suprasystolic pressure,
<BR><BR>c. decreasing the pressure induced by the pressure inducing means over time
     to a pressure below diastolic pressure,
<BR><BR>d. obtaining a data stream from the transducer means, the data stream
     including pressure data and pulsation signal data,
<BR><BR>e. processing said data stream to create an information stream which
     correlates the pressure data and the pulsation signal data, the
     information stream including at least two pulse maximum points and at
     least two pulse minimum points, and
<BR><BR>f. examining the information stream to determine at least one of the
     systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressures of the patient by
     selecting at least one of the at least two pulse minimum points as a point
     for determining said at least one of the systolic, diastolic and mean
     arterial pressure of the patient.
<BR><BR>2. The method of claim 1 wherein said at least two pulse maximum points
     comprise at least two consecutive pulse maximum points and the step of
     selecting at least one of the at least two pulse minimum points comprises
     the step of selecting a pulse minimum point between the at least two pulse
     maximum points which meets at least one of the following criteria:
<BR><BR>(a) the pulse minimum point occurs between a pair of consecutive pulse
     maximum points wherein the first pulse maximum point is substantially less
     than the second pulse maximum point, and
<BR><BR>(b) the pulse minimum point occurs between a pair of consecutive pulse
     maximum points wherein the first pulse maximum point is substantially
     greater than the second pulse maximum point.
<BR><BR>3. The method of claim 1 further comprising the steps of providing a
     graphic display means and graphically displaying the information stream.
<BR><BR>4. The method of claim 3 wherein the step of graphically displaying the
     information stream comprises the step of graphically displaying the
     pulsation signal data as a function of cuff pressure.
<BR><BR>5. The method of claim 3 wherein the step of graphically displaying the
     information stream comprises the step of graphically displaying the
     pulsation signal data as a function of time.
<BR><BR>6. The method of claim 3 wherein the step of providing a graphic display
     means comprises the step of providing a video display means.
<BR><BR>7. The method of claim 3 wherein the step of providing a graphic display
     means comprises the step of providing a printer means.
<BR><BR>8. The method of claim 1 wherein the step of creating an information stream
     comprises the step of creating a generally sinusoidal information stream
     curve, the at least two pulse maximum points comprising apex points of the
     generally sinusoidal information stream curve, and the at least two pulse
     minimum points comprise nadir points of the generally sinusoidal
     information stream curve, the generally sinusoidal information stream
     curve including at least one pulse cycle defined as an interval of the
     curve between a pair of consecutive pulse maximum points.
<BR><BR>9. The method of claim 8 wherein the at least one pulse cycle includes a
     pulsation signal rapidly descending portion, a pulse signal trough portion
     and a pulse signal rapidly ascending portion.
<BR><BR>10. The method of claim 9 wherein the step of examining the information
     stream to determine at least one of the systolic, diastolic and mean
     arterial pressures by selecting at least one of the at least two pulse
     minimum points as a point for determining said at least one of the
     systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressures of the patient comprises
     the step of selecting said at least one pulse minimum point as a point for
     determing the systolic pressure of the patient.
<BR><BR>11. The method of claim 10 wherein the step of selecting the at least one
     pulse minimum point comprises the step of selecting the pulse minimum
     point of the pulse cycle wherein the pulse minimum point occurs at the
     beginning of the pulse signal trough portion of the pulse cycle.
<BR><BR>12. The method of claim 10 wherein the step of selecting the at least one
     pulse minimum point comprises the step of selecting the pulse minimum
     point of the pulse cycle wherein the pulse minimum point occurs at the
     first data point of the pulse signal trough portion.
<BR><BR>13. The method of claim 9 wherein the step of examining the information
     stream to determine at least one of the systolic, diastolic and mean
     arterial pressures by selecting at least one of the at least two pulse
     minimum points as a point for determining said at least one of the
     systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure of the patient comprises
     the step of selecting said at least one pulse minimum point as a point for
     determining the diastolic pressure of the patient.
<BR><BR>14. The method of claim 13 wherein the step of selecting the at least one

<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>The present invention relates generally to a method and apparatus for
     determining blood pressure and more particularly to a non-invasive method
     and apparatus for determining blood pressure, and for providing the
     medical practitioner with information about the operation of the
     cardiovascular system of a patient.
<BR><BR>One test often performed on patients by medical practitioners is a test to
     determine the blood pressure of the patient. Blood pressure is tested
     often because a knowledge of a patient's blood pressure provides an
     overall reflection of the functioning of his heart and circulatory system.
<BR><BR>The blood pressure in a patient's arterial system is represented by the
     peak systolic and diastolic levels of the pressure pulse and is modified
     by cardiac output, peripheral arteriolar resistance, distensibility of the
     arteries, amount of blood in the system, and viscosity of the blood.
     Accordingly, changes in blood pressure reflect changes in these
     measurements. For example, the decrease in vessel distensibility in the
     elderly lowers diastolic pressure and increases systolic pressure to
     produce systolic hypertension. Increases in blood volume may raise both
     systolic and diastolic components.
<BR><BR>Normal blood pressure in the aorta and large arteries, such as the brachial
     artery, varies between 100 and 140 millimeters of mercury mm Hg systolic
     and between 60 and 90 mm Hg diastolic. Pressure in the smaller arteries is
     somewhat less, and in the arterioles, where the blood enters the
     capillaries, it is about 35 mm Hg. However, a wide variation of normal
     blood pressure exists, and a value may fall outside the normal range in
     healthy adults. The normal range also varies with age, sex and race. For
     example, a pressure reading of 100/60 may be normal for one person but
     hypotensive for another.
<BR><BR>Arterial blood pressure can be measured directly or indirectly. The most
     common known method for measuring blood pressure indirectly is with a
     sphygmomanometer and stethoscope. The primary benefits of the
     sphygmomanometer and stethoscope procedure are that it is simple for the
     medical practitioner to use, is non-invasive and is relatively
     inexpensive. The sphygmomanometer and stethoscope are often sufficiently
     inexpensive to make their cost well within the reach of consumers who
     desire to perform blood pressure tests at home. The primary drawback of
     the use of the sphygmomanometer and stethoscope procedure resides in the
     limited amount of data that it provides, and the relative inaccuracy of
     the procedure.
<BR><BR>The procedure by which a sphygmomanometer is utilized to determine blood
     pressure is relatively simple. A collapsed, inflatable blood pressure cuff
     is affixed snugly and smoothly to a patient's arm, with the distal margin
     of the cuff at least 3 cm above the anticubital fossa.
<BR><BR>Pressure in the cuff is then rapidly increased to a level of about 30 mm Hg
     above the point at which the palpable pulse disappears. As the cuff is
     deflated, observations may be made either by palpation or auscultation.
     The point at which the pulse can be felt is recorded from the manometer as
     the palpatry systolic pressure.
<BR><BR>The ausculatory method is usually preferred to the technique described
     above. With this method, vibrations from the artery under pressure, called
     Korotkoff sounds, are used as indicators.
<BR><BR>To determine blood pressure using the ausculatory method, the bell or
     diaphram of a stethoscope is pressed lightly over a brachial artery while
     the cuff is slowly deflated. The pressure readings begin at the time the
     Korotkoff sounds first become audible. As the cuff is deflated further,
     the sounds become louder for a brief period. The sounds then become
     muffled and finally disappear. The systolic blood pressure is the point at
     which the Korotkoff sounds become audible, and the diastolic blood
     pressure is the point at which the sounds cease to be heard. The
     traditional manual sphygmomanometer may provide inaccurate blood pressure
     measurements because it relies too much on human hearing sensitivity and
     the experience of the operator.
<BR><BR>In addition to the "manual" method described above for indirectly measuring
     blood pressure, several electronic devices exist which measure blood
     pressure according to the same theory as discussed above. One of these
     devices is the MARSHALL ASTROPULSE 78 Model blood pressure measuring
     device which is manufactured by the Marshall Medical Corporation of
     Lincolnshire, Illinois.
<BR><BR>One problem with the electronic methods discussed above is that they do not
     provide very accurate measurements of blood pressure.
<BR><BR>Electronic devices may not be able to measure all patients' blood pressure
     accurately because electronic devices usually depend upon some pre-assumed
     signal conditions for determining blood pressure. For example, female
     patients typically have a thicker fat layer than male patients. This
     thicker fat layer can lead to a less accurate blood pressure measurement
     in female patients.
<BR><BR>Another difficulty encountered with the above-described indirect blood
     pressure measurement techniques is that they only provide a rather limited
     amount of information. Specifically, they do not provide significant
     information relating to the dynamics of the cardiovascular system of the
     patient, such as information relating to the volume of blood flowing
     through the cardiovascular system and the operation of the valves of the
     heart.
<BR><BR>Another method for measuring blood pressure is by a direct measurement
     technique. In a direct measurement of arterial blood pressure, a needle or
     catheter is inserted into the brachial, radial, or femoral artery of the
     patient. A plastic tube filled with heparinized saline solution connects
     the catheter to a pressure sensitive device or a strain-gauge transducer.
     The mechanical energy that the blood exerts on the transducer's recording
     membrane is converted into changes in electrical voltage or current that
     can be calibrated in millimeters of mercury. The electrical signal can
     then be transmitted to an electronic recorder and an oscilloscope, which
     continually records and displays the pressure waves.
<BR><BR>This direct measurement technique is more accurate than the indirect
     sphygmomanometer method, and yields an electrically integrated mean
     pressure. However, as will be appreciated, the direct measurement
     technique has several drawbacks. The invasive nature of the technique
     makes it more difficult for the practitioner, as well as less convenient,
     and more traumatic for the patient.
<BR><BR>One other method for indirectly measuring blood pressure is disclosed in
     Geddes, et al., "The Indirect Measurement of Mean Blood Pressure in the
     Horse," THE SOUTHWESTERN VETERINARIAN, Summer, 1970, p. 289-294. The
     Geddes article describes the indirect measurement of blood pressure
     through the oscillometric method.
<BR><BR>The oscillometric method is concerned with the amplitude of the
     oscillations communicated to a cuff encircling a body member containing a
     suitably large artery. During deflation of the cuff from above systolic
     pressure, a sequence of oscillations on the cuff-pressure indicator can be
     seen. At suprasystolic pressure, small oscillations in cuff pressure are
     evident. When cuff pressure falls just below systolic pressure, the
     amplitude of the oscillations increases. With continued deflation of the
     cuff, the oscillations grow in amplitude, reach a maximum, and then
     decrease continually until the cuff pressure drops below the diastolic
     pressure of the patient. Currently, several digital-display electronic
     blood pressure monitors are commerically available which utilize the
     oscillometric method. One such commerically available device is the
     NORELCO.RTM. brand HC-3001 Model home use blood pressure measuring device
     which is manufactured by the North American Phillips Corporation of
     Stamford, Connecticut.
<BR><BR>The Geddes article also discusses the measurement of mean arterial pressure
     (MAP). MAP is defined as the average pressure that pushes blood through
     the circulatory system in the human body. True MAP is not the arithmetic
     average of systolic and diastolic pressure, but rather depends on the
     height and contour of the arterial pressure wave. True MAP is dependent
     upon a patient's Cardiac Output (CO) and the Total Peripheral Resistance
     (TPR) of the patient's cardiovascular system. Due to this relation, the
     equation
<BR><BR>MAP=(CO) (TPR)
<BR><BR>is often used by medical practitioners to describe MAP.
<BR><BR>MAP is believed by many practitioners to be the most important measurement
     of blood flow through the circulatory system. It is essential for a
     practitioner to know the patient's MAP when deciding whether to prescribe
     medicines for the patient to control hypertension. For a further
     discussion of MAP determinations, see the Geddes article.
<BR><BR>The device described in Geddes consists of a battery operated electronic
     oscillometer which displays cuff pressure and the oscillations in cuff
     pressure. Within the device is a pressure transducer, an amplifier and a
     rapidly responding meter which displays only the amplitude of the
     oscillations in cuff pressure. A gain control is provided to adjust the
     amplitude of the display of the oscillations. Additionally, an auxilliary
     output jack is provided to permit the oscillations to be recorded on a
     graphic recorder. Geddes utilized the oscillometer discussed above
     simultaneously with a direct pressure measuring device on the same animal
     at the same time to compare the accuracy of his indirect measurements with
     the direct measurements. Geddes found that his indirect oscillation method
     was not as accurate as the direct method, with the average ratio of
     indirect to direct pressure being about 0.92:1.
<BR><BR>Another indirect method and apparatus for measuring blood pressure is
     described in Ramsey U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,360,029 and 4,349,034. The '029 and
     '034 patents are related, and disclose generally identical subject matter.
<BR><BR>The Ramsey patents relate to an automatic indirect blood pressure reading
     method and apparatus which automatically and adaptively pump up an arm
     cuff. The cuff is pumped to a proper pressure by taking the previous cuff
     pressure measurement and adding approximately 60 mm to the old pressure
     before beginning measurement of the amplitude of the oscillations in the
     cuff. Once the amplitude of oscillations at the starting pressure are
     measured, the cuff is deflated a determined pressure increment to a lower
     pressure. The oscillations at this lower cuff pressure are then measured.
<BR><BR>Ramsey requires that the pressure oscillations satisfy a plurality of
     artifact detecting tests before a peak oscillation measurement is accepted
     as valid. Should an artifact be detected, additional oscillations are
     measured until the oscillations tested free of artifacts. When this
     integrity test is satisfied or some predetermined time interval is
     exceeded, the cuff is once again deflated a pressure increment. The
     apparatus continues in this fashion until maximum amplitude oscillations
     are obtained at the lowest cuff pressure, which is indicative of the mean
     arterial pressure.
<BR><BR>Notwithstanding the above discussed advances in the indirect measurement of
     blood pressure, room for improvement exists. It is therefore one object of
     the present invention to provide a method and apparatus for measuring
     blood pressure which provides the medical practitioner with a more
     accurate method of measuring blood pressure, and which provides the
     practitioner with information regarding the cardiovascular system beyond
     that of mere systolic and diastolic arterial pressures.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a method is
     provided for determining blood pressure of a patient. The method comprises
     the steps of affixing a non-invasive pressure inducing means and
     transducer means to the patient. A data stream is obtained from the
     transducer means. The data stream includes pressure data and pulsation
     signal data. The data stream is processed to create an information stream
     which correlates the pressure data and the pulsation signal data. The
     information stream includes at least two systolic maximum points and at
     least one diastolic minimum point. At least one of the systolic, diastolic
     and mean arterial pressures of the patient are determined by choosing a
     pressure determination point in the information stream between the two
     systolic maximum points.
<BR><BR>Preferably, the method also includes the steps of providing a graphic
     display means and graphically displaying the information stream.
<BR><BR>In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a method is
     provided for determining mean arterial blood pressure of a patient. The
     method comprises the steps of affixing a non-invasive pressure inducing
     means and a transducer means to the patient. A data stream is obtained
     from the transducer means. The data stream includes pulsation signal data.
     The data stream is processed to create an information stream which
     includes pulsation signal data and time data. The patient's systolic and
     diastolic pressures are determined. A pressure determination point is
     chosen in the information stream. The chosen pressure determination point
     is then utilized along with the determined systolic and diastolic
     pressures to determine the patient's mean arterial pressure.
<BR><BR>In accordance with a third aspect of the present invention, an apparatus is
     provided for determining blood pressure of a patient. The apparatus
     comprises a non-invasive pressure inducing means and a transducer means
     which are attachable to the patient for providing a data stream including
     a pressure data and pulsation signal data. Processing means are provided
     for processing the data to create an information stream which correlates
     the pressure data and the pulsation signal data. A graphic display means
     is provided for graphically displaying the information stream so created.
<BR><BR>One feature of the present invention is that an information stream
     comprised of pressure data and pulsation data is provided. From this
     information stream, an instantaneous point is chosen for determining the
     patient's systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure or mean
     arterial pressure. This feature of using an "instantaneous point" has the
     advantage of enabling the medical practitioner to determine diastolic, and
     systolic blood pressures and mean arterial pressures more accurately than
     known, prior non-invasive blood pressure determining techniques.
<BR><BR>Another feature of the present invention is that the apparatus of the
     present invention utilizes a non-invasive pressure determining means, such
     as a cuff pressure sleeve, sphygmomanometer and transducer. This feature
     has the advantage of making the blood pressure determination process more
     convenient for the medical practitioner and less risky for the patient
     than invasive pressure determining techniques.
<BR><BR>It is also a feature of a preferred embodiment of the present invention
     that a graphic display means is provided for graphically displaying the
     information stream, and a data storage means is provided for storing the
     information stream. The graphic display feature has the advantage of
     providing the medical practitioner with valuable data about the operation
     of the heart and circulatory system, such as the operation of the valves
     in the heart. The storage feature has the advantage of promoting a proper
     diagnosis of the patient's condition by enabling the medical practitioner
     to compare the current condition of the patient's heart and circulatory
     system against a prior, stored set of data showing the conditions of the
     patient's heart at an earlier date. Through an evaluation of the
     differences between the prior and current information streams, the medical
     practitioner can better analyze the current condition of the patient's
     heart and better determine whether there is any improvement or
     deterioration in the patient's condition.
<BR><BR>A further feature of the present invention is that it provides two methods
     for determining Mean Arterial Pressure. These two methods are referred to
     herein as "the midpoint method" and the "mathematical calculation method."
<BR><BR>It was found by the applicant that both the midpoint method and the
     mathematical calculation method have the advantage of providing more
     consistant MAP results than the maximum pulse amplitude method, which is
     described in the Geddes article. The midpoint method of the present
     invention determines the patient's MAP by utilizing the cuff pressure,
     below the systolic pressure, when the pulse cycle minimum reaches the
     midpoint on the cuff pressure axis between two consecutive arterial pulse
     signal maximum points. The midpoint method has the advantage of not
     requiring the medical practitioner to predetermine the patient's systolic
     and diastolic pressures. The midpoint method is well-suited for use in
     routine blood pressure monitoring situations and in situations wherein a
     numerical, electronic read-out device having limited memory and computing
     capability is employed.
<BR><BR>The mathematical calculation method comprises a computation of the mean of
     a patient's pulsation wave form data. To utilize the mathematical
     calculation method of the present invention, a pressure determination
     point is chosen at a cuff pressure below the patient's diastolic pressure.
     To choose a pressure determination point, a point is chosen in the
     information stream between a systolic maximum and a diastolic minimum,
     wherein the rate of change of the cuff pressure data versus pulse signal
     data changes significantly. The above described point is referred to as
     the "deflection point." The deflection point is chosen as a point at which
     to mathematically calculate MAP because this deflection point represents
     the point at which the patient's aortic valve is closed, and thus
     represents the intrinsic blood pressure at the point wherein the aortic
     valve is closed. The point wherein the aortic valve is closed is chosen
     because it is at this point that the patient experiences the most long
     lasting and significant "push" of blood through his circulatory system.
<BR><BR>The mathematical calculation method has several advantages over the
     midpoint method. One advantage is that the mathematical calculation method
     is less sensitive to low frequency noises, such as breathing noises and
     body movement noises. These low frequency noises can interfere with the
     accuracy of the results of the test. Further, the mathematical calculation
     method can be utilized with cuffless blood pressure measuring devices.
<BR><BR>When the mathematical calculation method is used with cuff devices, the
     results are less affected by the design and stability of the cuff.
     Additionally, the mathematical calculation method provides generally more
     consistent and accurate results than the midpoint method. Because of the
     enhanced consistency and accuracy of the mathematical calculation method,
     it is particularly well suited to situations such as surgical procedures
     requiring highly accurate and consistent information. The mathematical
     calculation method does have some disadvantages (when compared to the
     midpoint method) in that the mathematical calculation method generally
     requires the use of a device having greater memory and computing
     capabilities.
<BR><BR>Additional features and advantages of the present invention will become
     apparent to those skilled in the art upon consideration of the following

<BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
<BR><BR>A. Components
<BR><BR>FIG. 1 presents a block diagram illustrating the components which comprise
     the apparatus of the present invention, and which are utilized in
     conjunction with the method of the present invention.
<BR><BR>The apparatus of the present invention includes a non-invasive pressure
     inducing means such as cuff 10 for exerting a pressure on a body part,
     such as the arm. A transducer means 16 is provided for picking up the
     total pressure, including the background pressure and the small
     oscillation (pulsation) signals. Typically, the background pressure
     signals are picked up as DC signals, and the pulsation signals are picked
     up as AC signals. The background pressure signals and pulsation signals
     picked up are those signals induced by the cuff 10.
<BR><BR>The transducer means 16 converts these signals so picked up into an
     electrical signal. A graphic display of the data stream which results from
     these signals is shown in FIG. 1A.
<BR><BR>Although a wide variety of pressure inducing means can be used, the
     pressure inducing means preferably comprises an inflatable cuff 10 which
     can be wrapped around a limb of a patient.
<BR><BR>Typically, such an inflatable cuff 10 includes a pump means (either
     manually activated or electronically activated) which pumps air into the
     interior of the cuff 10 to exert pressure on the body part. An example of
     such a cuff 10 is the cuff supplied with the Norelco blood pressure
     monitor Model No. HC-3001 cuff which is manufactured by the North American
     Phillips Corporation of Stamford, Connecticut.
<BR><BR>Additionally, most, if not all, commerically available cuffs provided as a
     part of an oscillometric blood pressure monitoring system can be utilized
     in conjunction with the present invention, so long as a compatible adaptor
     is utilized to connect the cuff 10 to the pressure transducer means 16.
     Further, with more extensive modification, cuffs designed for use with
     nonoscillometric blood pressure monitoring devices can also be utilized
     with the present invention.
<BR><BR>Preferably, the cuff 10 should include a pressure stop valve which permits
     the user to maintain a selected, constant pressure in the 20 to 200 mm Hg
     pressure range. The stop valve feature is useful in that it permits the
     user to obtain arterial pulse wave forms, and thereby extract additional
     information about the patient's cardiovascular condition. Examples of such
     arterial wave forms are shown in FIGS. 7, 7A, 8 and 8A, and will be
     discussed in more detail below.
<BR><BR>The pressure transducer 16 primarily comprises a solid state pressure
     sensor or similar device which is capable of picking up pressure signals,
     and converting these pressure signals into an analog electrical signal for
     transmission from the transducer means 16. An example of a commerically
     available transducer which can operate in conjunction with the present
     invention is the pressure transducer supplied with the Norelco blood
     pressure monitor, Model No. HC-3001, discussed above.
<BR><BR>Preferably, the pressure transducer 16 will have a linear response rate, or
     will have a known correlation between the input pressure received by the
     transducer 16 and the output electrical signal (e.g. voltage) sent out by
     the transducer 16. The linear response or known correlation
     characteristics facilitate the calibration of the transducer 16 against a
     standard pressure gauge, such as a mercury pressure gauge. Additionally,
     the transducer 16 should have a fast response rate and a wide frequency
     response. Preferably, the response rate should be less than or equal to
     0.001 second, and the frequency of the response rate should be between
     about 0.2 hertz and 50 hertz or higher. It has been found by the applicant
     that a fast response rate and a wide frequency response contribute to an
     accurate determination of the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and
     the mean arterial pressure.
<BR><BR>The transducer 16 generates a voltage signal which comprises a generally
     continuous overall pressure data stream 20. The overall pressure data
     stream 20 is sent in a generally continuous manner to the analog to
     digital convertor 26. The analog to digital convertor 26 converts the
     analog information provided by the transducer 16 into digital information.
     The analog to digital convertor 26 should preferably have a sampling rate
     of 4,000 samples per second or higher; a resolution of 12 bits or better;
     more than one channel for other multi-purpose applications; and the
     capability to convert digital signals to analog signals for feedback
     control.
<BR><BR>Although the above mentioned qualities are preferred, they may not be
     necessary since the bit resolution and sampling rate of the final data
     acquired depends largely on the software program utilized in conjunction
     with the present invention. Generally, a combination of a software package
     and an analog to digital convertor 26 that will provide final data
     acquisition of better than 100 items of data per second is adequate for
     the present invention. However, better digitizing resolution in the data
     stream 20 is always preferable. An example of an analog to digital
     convertor which will perform the functions necessary for the instant
     invention is the Eight Channel, High Speed analog to digital convertor,
     Model No. DAS-8, which is manufactured by the MetraByte Corporation of
     Taunton, Massachusetts.
<BR><BR>A digitized pressure data stream 30 is fed from the analog to digital
     convertor 26 to a data processing means such as computer 36. As with data
     stream 20, the digitized data stream 30 represents an essentially
     continuous data stream. The computer 36 should preferably have a fast
     clock speed (e.g. 4.7 megahertz or faster); a large enough memory to store
     the data (e.g. 256 kilobytes or greater); and an easy disk operation
     system, such as the IBM.RTM. DOS operation system.
<BR><BR>It should also be noted that the computing speed and memory size required
     for performing the tasks of the present invention depend on the particular
     software chosen. Thus, with the proper software, the user might be able to
     utilize a computer 36 having a smaller memory and a slower clock speed.
     Generally, a clock speed (e.g., 10,000 Hz) fast enough to achieve a final
     data aquisition rate of better than 100 data bits per second is adequate
     for the present invention. Further, a memory of less than 256 kilobytes
     can be utilized if a graphic program is used which is more simple than the
     LOTUS.RTM. 1-2-3 program utilized in conjunction with the present
     invention.
<BR><BR>Examples of computers 36 which have sufficient clock speed and memory to
     perform the functions necessary in the instant invention include the
     IBM.RTM. Model PC, PC/XT, and PC/AT computers which are manufactured by
     the IBM Corporation, and their compatible equivalents. Examples of such
     compatible equivalents can be found in most computer related magazines.
<BR><BR>As will be appreciated, the computers 36 described above will not process
     the information of the data stream 20 without proper software to perform
     the processing. The software utilized in conjunction with the present
     invention should perform several functions.
<BR><BR>The first function performed by the software is to control the analog to
     digital convertor 26, so that the digitized data stream 30 can be received
     by the computer 36. A second function performed by the software is to
     convert the digitalized data stream 30 into ASC II format and store the
     data in a data storage means such as a disk 50 so that the data can be
     retrieved by a program such as LOTUS.RTM. 1-2-3 for further data
     processing and graphic display. A third function of the software is to
     receive and to input total time. This inputting of total time starts the
     converting performed by the analog to digital convertor 26 at time zero on
     the computer's 36 internal clock, and ends the analog to digital
     converting when the total time is up.
<BR><BR>A fourth function performed by the software is to filter out the AC
     oscillation component of digitized data stream 30, so that a DC pressure
     curve of the cuff pressure and a separate AC pulsation stream are
     obtained. This step need not be performed by the software, as a hardware
     filter can be employed to separate the AC and DC components of the
     pressure signal obtained from the pressure transducer 16 before the data
     stream 20 is fed to the analog to digital converter 26.
<BR><BR>A fifth function of the software is to calibrate the DC cuff pressure curve
     by utilizing a precalibrated factor. This precalibrated factor is a number
     obtained by comparing the digitized number from the analog to digital
     convertor 26 to either a standard pressure gauge reading or to the digital
     reading of a digital blood pressure monitoring device which is utilized
     simultaneously in conjunction with the present invention. The sixth
     function performed by the software is to perform various necessary
     mathematical calculations, such as integration, derivation, etc.
<BR><BR>The software utilized by the applicant in conjunction with the present
     invention comprises a two component software package. The first component
     comprises a translation component, and the second component comprises a
     data manipulation and graphic display component.
<BR><BR>The translation program comprises a data acquisition program, which was
     written by the applicant to collect data from the data stream 30, and to
     store the data in a data storage device such as a disk 50 or hard drive
     (not shown). The translation component collects the data and translates it
     into a form usable by the data manipulation/graphic display component so
     that the data manipulation/graphic display component can manipulate the
     data into a usable form and display it graphically. The functions
     performed by the translation program are (1) noise filtering to filter out
     spike noises, (2) fitting the curve to the data points obtained, and (3)
     calibrating the pressure data to millimeters of Mercury. One example of a
     commerically available translation program which can perform the functions
     necessary to perform in the present invention is the LAB TECH NOTEBOOK
     data acquisition software program Model LTN-03, which is manufactured by
     the MetraByte Corporation of Taunton, Massachusetts.
<BR><BR>The data manipulation/graphic display component is a data base program
     which remanipulates the data and graphically displays the data on a
     graphic display means 42. An example of a data manipulation/graphic
     display program which functions in conjunction with the present invention
     is the LOTUS.RTM. 1-2-3 which is manufactured by LOTUS Development
     Corporation of Cambridge, Massachusetts.
<BR><BR>The data processing means 36 feeds a generally continuous information
     stream 40 to a graphic display means, such as a video screen 42 for the
     computer 36. Alternately, an information stream 44 can be fed to a printer
     46 to construct a permanent record of the information contained in the
     information stream 44. As will be appreciated, printer 46 also comprises a
     graphic display means. Preferably, the printer 46 used should be either a
     dot-matrix printer or a laser printer having the capability to display the
     information stream 44 graphically.
<BR><BR>As another alternative, an information stream 48 can be fed to a data
     storage means, such as a disk 50 or a hard drive for storage and later
     retrieval. Through the use of the data storage means to store the data
     produced by the patient, the medical practitioner can be provided with
     access to current and historical data about the patient.
<BR><BR>Although information streams 40, 44, 48 are given three separate
     designating numbers, it will be appreciated that information streams 40,
     44, 48 all contain essentially the same information.
<BR><BR>B. Procedure to Operate the Invention
<BR><BR>The following procedure is employed in conjunction with the present
     invention. The cuff 10, is affixed to the patient and operated in
     accordance with its usual operating procedures. A generally continuous
     overall pressure data stream 20 is derived from the cuff 10 and transducer
     16, respectively, and fed into the analog to digital convertor 26. The
     analog to digital convertor 26 converts the analog information of the
     pressure data stream 20 into a digitalized pressure data stream 30.
<BR><BR>The digitized information contained in the data streams 30, 32 is then
     processed by the computer 36 to separate the AC component (the pulsation
     signal) and the DC component (the cuff pressure signal) from the overall
     pressure data stream 30 received by the computer 36. Further, the computer
     36 calibrates the cuff pressure data into units of millimeters of mercury
     to then create the information streams 40, 44, 48, wherein pulsation
     signal and cuff pressure are correlated to give pulsation signal as a
     function of cuff pressure. Additionally, pulsation signal and time are
     correlated to give the pulsation signal as a function of time.
<BR><BR>The information in the information streams 40, 44, 48 is then fed
     respectively to the video screen 42, printer 46, or disk 50. From the data
     so displayed, the systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressures of the
     patient can be determined along with other information about the
     cardiovascular system of the patient.
<BR><BR>A sample graphic display is shown in FIG. 1A which displays the information
     stream 40, 44, 48 produced by the present invention, wherein cuff pressure
     (uncalibrated) is shown as a function of time. The curve 49 of FIG. 1A is
     relevant in that it shows that during the test, the pressure exerted by
     cuff 10 is decreased smoothly over time. Although not readily apparent
     from the graph of FIG. 1A, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the
     art that the cuff pressure at the beginning of a blood pressure test
     should be greater than the patient's estimated systolic pressure, and the
     cuff pressure at the end of the test should be less than the patient's
     diastolic pressure.
<BR><BR>FIG. 1A is also relevant in that it shows that the duration of the test was
     thirty seconds, and that the rate of decrease of cuff pressure was
     generally constant during the test. Although the applicant employed a 30
     second test, a shorter or longer test period could be utilized. The use of
     a shorter test period would have the advantage of reducing the test time
     the patient would need to endure, but would have the disadvantage of
     reducing the accuracy of the test due to the fewer number of collected
     data points. A longer test would have the advantage of increasing the
     accuracy of the test due to the larger number of data points collected.
     However, the larger number of data points would likely delay the response
     time of the computer 36, and could overload the computer's 36 ability to
     handle the data.
<BR><BR>A generally smooth decrease in cuff pressure during the test is preferred
     as it facilitates the construction and interpretation of the graphic
     displays produced by the instant invention. However, in some circumstances
     it may be preferrable not to decrease the pressure generally linearly.
<BR><BR>There are several different manners in which the cuff pressure data,
     pulsation signal data and the time data so correlated can be processed,
     depending on the user's preference, and on the information so desired.
     Presented below are several examples of "modes of operation," along with
     an explanation of the information produced by these various modes, the
     uses to which the modes are put, and the value of each mode in diagnosing
     the condition of the patient.
<BR><BR>C. Modes of Operation
<BR><BR>1. First Mode. A graphic display is shown in FIG. 2 which illustrates the
     operation of the invention in its first mode. In this first mode, a curve
     51 is shown wherein the patient's pulse signal is displayed as a function
     of cuff pressure. FIG. 2 displays the pulse signal/cuff pressure curve 51
     throughout the entire duration of the test, which, in the present example
     is thirty seconds. The long time period displayed in this first mode is
     useful to the practitioner in that it helps the practitioner to determine
     whether any irregularities exist in the patient's pulse signal. For
     example, the display will show whether the patient missed a pulse signal,
     and whether the patient's pulse signals are spaced irregularly. A missed
     pulse signal or irregular spacing of the patient's pulse signals may
     indicate that the patient's heart has a serious functional problem.
<BR><BR>Curve 51 includes three primary regions: the systolic region 53, the mean
     arterial region 55, and the diastolic region 57. Although the boundaries
     of these regions cannot be defined with absolute precision, some
     generalizations can be made. The systolic region 53 comprises that portion
     of curve 51 wherein the arterial pulse signal first begins to rise. In
     curve 51, the systolic region 53 includes the area around apex points 54
     and 56. The mean arterial region 55 includes the area of curve 51 adjacent
     to the peak arterial pulse signal, which in curve 51 is the portion of
     curve 51 adjacent to apex point 68.
<BR><BR>The diastolic region 57 includes the region wherein the arterial pulse
     signal decreases rapidly, and in curve 51 includes the portion of curve 51
     adjacent to apex points 60, 62. Portions of the systolic region 53, the
     mean arterial region 55 and the diastolic region 57 of curve 51 are shown
     in more detail in FIGS. 4, 5, and 6, respectively.
<BR><BR>The display of the first mode also provides the practitioner with a quick
     determination of the patient's systolic pressure, diastolic pressure and
     mean arterial pressure. The systolic pressure is determined from the
     display in the following manner. It will be noted that a sharp rise in the
     arterial pulse signal occurs between apex point 54 and apex point 56. To
     determine the systolic pressure, one utilizes the nadir point 58 between
     apex points 54 and 56. One then reads the cuff pressure at nadir point 58
     to obtain a quick estimate of the patient's systolic pressure. In the
     instant example, the cuff pressure at nadir point 58 is approximately 140
     mm Hg.
<BR><BR>To determine the diastolic pressure, one utilizes the portion of the curve
     51 where the arterial pulse signal is decreasing. One then looks for apex
     points, such as apex points 60, 62 wherein a relatively large decrease in
     the arterial pulse signal occurs. The nadir point 64 between apex point
     60, 62 is chosen, and the cuff pressure at the nadir point 64 is utilized
     as the diastolic pressure. In the instant example, the diastolic pressure
     of the patient at nadir point 64 is approximately 87 mm Hg.
<BR><BR>To determine an estimate of the patient's mean arterial pressure from the
     graph of FIG. 2, one utilizes the nadir point 67 following the highest
     apex point 68 displayed on the graph. One then reads the cuff pressure at
     this nadir point 67 to obtain an estimate of the patient's mean arterial
     pressure, which, in the instant example is about 93 mm. Hg.
<BR><BR>2. The Second Mode. A graphic display of the information streams 40, 44, 48
     obtained through the operation of the present invention in its second mode
     is shown in FIGS. 3, 4 and 5. More particularly, FIG. 3 displays an
     information stream wherein the arterial pulse signal is shown as a
     function of cuff pressure in the systolic range of the patient; FIG. 4
     displays an information stream showing the arterial pulse signal as a
     function of cuff pressure in the mean arterial range; and FIG. 5 displays
     the arterial pulse signal as a function of cuff pressure in the diastolic
     pressure range.
<BR><BR>The determination of the systolic pressure of the patient according to the
     present invention will now be explained with reference to FIG. 3. It will
     be noted that FIG. 3 comprises a graphic display of a portion 69 of curve
     51 of the generally continuous information stream. The curve portion 69
     includes a series of data points such as data points 71, which are
     separated in time generally by 0.037 second. These data points 71 include
     a series of nadir points, such as nadir points 72, 73, and a series of
     apex points, such as apex points 74, 75. Apex points 74, 75, relate to
     pulse cycle (systolic) maximas in a particular pulse cycle, and the nadir
     points 72,73 represent pulse cycle minimum points. For purposes of this
     discussion, a pulse cycle is defined as a segment of the curve portion 69
     between any two apex points, such as the third cycle 78, which includes
     that part of the curve portion 69 between apex point 74 and apex point 75.
     It should also be noted that each cycle, such as fourth cycle 79, includes
     three portions: a rapidly descending portion 81, a trough portion 83 and a
     rapidly ascending portion 85. The rapidly descending portion 81 of each
     cycle is the interval of the cycle wherein the arterial pulse signal
     decreases rapidly relative to the change in cuff pressure. The rapidly
     descending portion 81 is characterized by a wide spacing between points,
     and in fourth cycle 79 includes the interval between apex point 75 and
     nadir point 88. The trough portion 83 of each cycle is the interval of the
     cycle wherein the change of arterial pulse signal relative to the change
     in cuff pressure is generally less than in either the rapidly descending
     portion 81 or the rapidly ascending portion 85. The trough portion 83 is
     characterized by relatively close spacing of the data points, and in the
     fourth cycle 79 includes the interval between nadir point 88 and data
     point 89. The rapidly ascending portion 85 of each cycle is the interval
     of each cycle wherein the arterial pulse signal increases rapidly relative
     to the change in cuff pressure. Similiar to rapidly descending portion 81,
     rapidly ascending portion 85 is characterized by wide spacing between data
     points. In fourth cycle 79, the rapidly ascending portion 85 is the
     interval of cycle 79 between data point 89 and apex point 91.
<BR><BR>A pressure determination point is chosen from curve portion 69. The cuff
     pressure at this pressure determination point comprises the systolic
     pressure of the patient. In curve portion 69 the pressure determination
     point is the nadir point 72 of the third cycle 78. Nadir point 72 is
     chosen as the pressure determination point because it meets the following
     three criteria.
<BR><BR>The first criteria met by nadir point 72 is that nadir point 72 comprises
     the nadir point between the apex points 74,75 wherein a large rise occurs
     in the arterial pulse signals at the apex points (or systolic maxima).
<BR><BR>A second criteria for choosing nadir point 72 is that it comprises the
     nadir point in the cycle 78, wherein a substantial decrease occurs in the
     arterial pulse signals between nadir points 72,73 of adjacent cycles.
<BR><BR>The third criteria for choosing nadir point 72 relates to the relative
     position of nadir point 72 in pulse cycle 78. If one were to draw
     imaginary bisector lines, such as bisectors 80,82 which intersect the cuff
     pressure axis, and which bisect the respective second cycle 84 and third
     cycle 78, one would notice that the nadir point 73 of second cycle 84 is
     positioned generally adjacent to, or on bisector 80. However, it will also
     be noticed that nadir point 72 of the third cycle 78 is positioned to the
     left of bisector 82 and, in fact, is positioned at the extreme left of the
     trough portion 83 of the curve portion 69 in third cycle 78. In choosing a
     nadir point to serve as a pressure determining point, one chooses the
     nadir point 72 of the first cycle (here third cycle 78) wherein the nadir
     point 72 is located at or close to the beginning of the trough portion 83.
<BR><BR>By way of contrast, it should be noted that nadir points 86, 73 of the
     first and second cycle 84, respectively, are located near the center of
     the trough portion, and the nadir points 88,90 of the fourth and fifth
     cycles are located in a position similar to nadir point 72 at the extreme
     beginning or leftward most end of the trough portion of the respective
     fourth and fifth cycles.
<BR><BR>Using nadir point 72 as the pressure determination point, one can determine
     that the systolic pressure of the patient is 140.0 mm Hg. by reading the
     cuff pressure at the nadir point 72.
<BR><BR>The choice of nadir point 72 has physiological significance. Nadir point 72
     represents a point on the curve 51 wherein the pulse signal drops to its
     minimum almost immediately following its prior peak at apex point 74. This
     immediate drop in the pulse signal indicates that the interval of time
     between peak 74 and nadir point 72 represents the time at which the
     patients blood pressure overcomes the pressure of the cuff 10 to thereby
     permit a small amount of blood to flow through the arteries blocked by the
     cuff 10. This small amount of blood flow causes the sudden drop in the
     arterial pulse signal. This sudden drop is reflected in the graph by the
     positioning of nadir point 72 at the beginning of the trough portion of
     cycle 78, and is also reflected by the drop in arterial pulse signal
     between adjacent nadir points 73,72.
<BR><BR>The present invention provides a more accurate means for determining
     systolic pressure. As will be appreciated by medical practitioners, an
     accurate knowledge of a patient's systolic blood pressure is extremely
     useful in diagnosing a patient's condition. One reason the knowledge of
     systolic pressure is important is that practitioners often utilize a
     systolic pressure exceeding 140 mm Hg. as a benchmark for determining
     whether a patient is hypertensive.
<BR><BR>Determining systolic pressure accurately is not an easy task. A patient's
     systolic pressure is the highest pressure point of the cardiovascular
     system. Difficulty arises in determining systolic pressure since this
     highest point may only remain for a short period of time, for example, 0.1
     second or less. Due to the short duration of this highest point, the
     actual highest point systolic pressure may be missed by a practitioner or
     a device measuring systolic pressure, because the practitioner or device
     are incapable of capturing the systolic pressure at its highest point.
<BR><BR>The present invention overcomes many of these problems by better
     identifying the very point at which the patient's blood pressure reaches
     this highest point systolic pressure. By better identifying this highest
     point systolic pressure, the present invention provides generally more
     consistent data than that provided by known prior art electronic devices.
<BR><BR>A graphic display illustrating a patient's arterial pulse signal as a
     function of cuff pressure is shown in FIG. 4. Specifically, FIG. 4
     displays the patient's arterial pulse signal and cuff pressure in the
     range wherein the patient's mean arterial pressure can be calculated
     utilizing the "mid-point method" discussed above.
<BR><BR>FIG. 4 is similar to FIG. 3 in that it displays a generally sinusoidal
     portion 100 of curve 51 comprised of a generally continuous series of data
     points separated in time by about 0.037 seconds. Curve portion 100 is
     taken from the mean arterial range 55 of curve 51 and includes a series of
     apex points 102,104,106,108,110,112 and a series of nadir points
     114,116,118,120,122. The apex points 102,104,106,108,110,112 and nadir
     points 114,116,118,120,122 define a series of five pulse cycles, including
     a first cycle 126, second cycle 128, third cycle 130, fourth cycle 132,
     and fifth cycle 134. For purposes of illustration, imaginary bisectors
     138,140,142 have been drawn through the respective third cycle 130, fourth
     cycle 132, and fifth cycle 134.
<BR><BR>It has been found by the applicant that the patient's mean arterial
     pressure (MAP) can be determined by reading the cuff pressure from the
     graph of the nadir point 120 of the cycle 132 wherein the nadir point 120
     is positioned at the middle of the trough portion 144 of the cycle 132. To
     clarify this, it should be noted that nadir point 120 intercepts bisector
     140 of the fourth cycle 132. It should also be noted that the nadir point
     118 of the prior cycle (third cycle 130) falls generally to the left of
     bisector 138 and that the nadir point 122 of the succeeding cycle (fifth
     cycle 134) falls to the right of bisector 142. When one reads the cuff
     pressure at nadir point 120, one finds that the patient's mean arterial
     pressure is approximately 93 mm Hg.
<BR><BR>It should be noted that the mean arterial pressure determined from FIG. 4
     (93 mm Hg) is essentially the same as the mean arterial pressure (94 mm
     Hg) estimated from FIG. 2, wherein the maximum amplitude point method was
     utilized. One advantage to the use of the mid-point method over the
     maximum amplitude method is that the mid-point method is generally not as
     sensitive to extraneous noises as the maximum amplitude method. The
     mid-point method is not as sensitive to noises for many of the same
     reasons that an FM radio signal is normally less noisy than an AM radio
     signal.
<BR><BR>Although the mid-point method of the present invention does provide an
     advance over the maximum amplitude method, the mathematical calculation
     method is likely more accurate than the mid-point method. The mathematical
     calculation method is likely more accurate because it is less affected by
     the patient breathing deeply, the interposition of a sleeve between the
     cuff 10 and the body part, and the presence of a significant fat layer
     between the arteries and skin layer of the patient. The mathematical
     calculation method is discussed below as the third mode of the present
     invention.
<BR><BR>A graphic display is presented in FIG. 5 which demonstrates the
     determination of a patient's diastolic blood pressure according to the
     present invention. FIG. 5 displays a generally sinusoidal curve portion
     150 of curve 51, which is comprised of a series of data points separated
     in time by about 0.037 second. Curve portion 150 overlaps with curve
     portion 100 (FIG. 4) insofar as both curve portions 100, 150 share two
     apex points 110,112, two nadir points 120,122 and cycle 134. Curve portion
     150 also includes apex points 156,158,160 and nadir points
     164,166,168,170. These apex points 110,112, 156,158,160 and nadir points
     122,164,166,168,170 define five pulse cycles 134,176,178,180,182.
     Bisectors 184,186 have been drawn through cycles 176 and 178,
     respectively, in a manner similar to the bisectors 80,82 of FIG. 3 and the
     bisectors 138,140,142 of FIG. 4.
<BR><BR>To choose a pressure determination point, one chooses a nadir point 166 and
     reads the cuff pressure (85 mm Hg) at the pressure determining nadir point
     166. To determine which nadir point to use as the pressure determination
     point, one uses the nadir point 166 which is located at, or adjacent to
     the end of the trough portion 188 of its respective cycle. As will be
     noted from the graph, nadir points 164,168,170 are generally not disposed
     adjacent to the end of their respective trough portions. As discussed in
     connection with FIG. 4, nadir point 120 is directly in the middle of the
     trough portion of its respective pulse cycle.
<BR><BR>Another way of viewing pressure determining nadir point 166 is that nadir
     point 166 is at or adjacent to the beginning the portion of cycle 178
     wherein the arterial pulse signal rises rapidly toward the successive apex
     point 158. The choice of a nadir point 166 which is disposed at or near
     the beginning of the rapidly ascending portion of a cycle as a pressure
     determining point has physiological significance. A nadir point 166 so
     positioned indicates that the pressure exerted by the cuff 10 is
     sufficiently insignificant so that the cuff 10 no longer restricts the
     flow of blood through the arteries. As will be familiar to medical
     practitioners, a patient's diastolic pressure is generally defined as the
     pressure at which the pressure exerted by a cuff 10 no longer restricts
     the flow of blood.
<BR><BR>The applicant found that utilizing this method provides a rather consistent
     and accurate determination of a patient's diastolic blood pressure.
<BR><BR>It is believed by applicant that the reason for this enhanced consistency
     and accuracy of the present invention is due to the fact that the present
     invention better captures the exact arterial pulse signal point wherein
     the pressure exerted by the cuff 10 no longer restricts the flow of blood
     past the cuff 10. Additionally the accuracy and consistency of the method
     of the present invention are enhanced because the present invention is
     less affected by external noises that can affect the amplification of
     pulses.
<BR><BR>3. Third Mode. A graphic display of the blood pressure determination method
     of the present invention in its third mode is shown in FIG. 6. The third
     mode is utilized to determine a patient's mean arterial pressure according
     to the "mathematical calculation method" of the present invention. The
     graphic display in FIG. 6 shows a single pulse cycle having a plurality of
     data points connected together to form a generally sinusoidal curve 200.
     Curve 200 correlates the arterial pressure of the patient as a function of
     time, with arterial pressure being displayed on the Y axis, and time being
     displayed on the X axis. Although cuff pressure is not shown in curve 200,
     the cuff pressure responding to curve 200 is a cuff pressure lower than
     the patient's measured diastolic pressure. The reasons for choosing a cuff
     pressure less than diastolic pressure will be explained in more detail
     below.
<BR><BR>The graphic display shown in FIG. 6 is constructed in the following manner.
     A single pulse cycle is utilized at a cuff pressure lower than the
     patient's measured diastolic pressure. The apex point 202 of the cycle is
     then set at the patient's measured systolic pressure. In the instant
     example, this is 140 mm Hg. The lowest point of the cycle, nadir point
     204, is then set at the patient's measured diastolic pressure. In the
     instant example, this is 85 mm Hg. Using these two known points, the graph
     is then calibrated by linearly interpolating arterial pressures between
     the measured systolic pressure and the measured diastolic pressure on the
     graph to create a linear scale of arterial pressures.
<BR><BR>It is apparent that the mean arterial pressure should be somewhere between
     the patient's systolic and diastolic pressures. A pressure determination
     (deflection) point 206 is chosen because it meets the following criteria:
     first, when measuring mean arterial pressure, the pressure determination
     point is a point on the curve 200 wherein the patient's arterial pressure
     is decreasing with time. In other words, the pressure determination point
     206 will be somewhere between the pulse maxima (apex point 202) and pulse
     minima (nadir point 204) and not at a point between the pulse minima
     (nadir point 204) and the pulse maxima of a succeeding cycle.
<BR><BR>The second criteria met by pressure determination point 206 is that it
     represents a point wherein the rate of change of arterial pressure vs.
     time changes significantly. When viewing the graph, this change is
     represented by a change in the slope of curve 200, wherein the slope of
     the curve 200 increases significantly. As shown in FIG. 6, the slope of
     the portion of curve 200 between apex point 202 and pressure determination
     point 206 is approximately minus 225 mm Hg per second, whereas the slope
     of the portion of curve 200 in the interval between pressure determination
     point 206 and nadir point 204 is approximately minus 40 mm Hg per second.
     Thus, it will be noticed that between pressure determination point 206 and
     nadir point 204, the slope of curve 200 increases significantly, although
     still remaining negative. Although the slope of the portion of the curve
     between the pressure determination point 206 and the nadir point 204
     remains negative, the applicant has found that occasionally the slope of
     the curve will become positive for a short interval of this portion, such
     as between pressure determination point 206 and the two or three points
     which follow pressure determination point 206. It will be appreciated by
     those familiar with calculus that pressure determination point 206 can
     also be described as a point wherein the first derivative of curve 200
     changes significantly or a point wherein the rate of change in the slope
     of curve 200 reaches a maximum in the interval between apex point 202 and
     nadir point 204.
<BR><BR>The applicant has found that the use of a "deflection point," such as point
     206, as a pressure determination point, yields quite consistent results in
     the measurement of the patient's mean arterial pressure. One experiment
     utilized by applicant to prove the consistency of this mathematical
     calculation method as an accurate and consistent determinor of mean
     arterial pressure is shown in FIGS. 6A and 6B.
<BR><BR>FIG. 6A shows a series of pulse cycles shown on a graph wherein arterial
     pulse signal is shown as a function of time. In the graphs of FIGS. 6A and
     6B, the arterial pulse signal equals zero (Y=0) line, is set to equal the
     mathematical true mean value of all pulsation signals displayed on the
     respective graphs. Another way of expressing this is that the area under
     entire curve 209 (FIG. 6A) equals the area of a rectangle defined by
     points A, B, C and D, which of course equals the area of the graph under
     the Y=0 line.
<BR><BR>FIG. 6A shows a curve 209 of twelve pulse cycles recorded over a period of
     approximately ten seconds at a cuff pressure between 50 and 40 mm Hg. As
     will be appreciated, a cuff pressure of 40-50 mm Hg is less than the
     patient's diastolic pressure, which is typically around 80 mm Hg. It will
     be noticed that the pressure determining deflection points 210 of each
     cycle tend to hover around the Y=0 line, thus proving that the deflection
     point does accurately reflect the mean arterial pressure of the patient.
<BR><BR>FIG. 6B is an expanded view of the first three cycles 212,214,216 shown in
     FIG. 6A. This expanded view illustrates more clearly that pressure
     determining deflection points correlate well between each other around the
     Y=0 line, and are not easily affected by other unknown oscillation noises.
     This fact is important in that it enables the present invention to provide
     a more precise method of determining mean arterial pressure than other
     known methods.
<BR><BR>It should be noted that the precision by which the mathematical calculation
     method of the present invention determines mean arterial pressure is
     dependent upon an accurate determination of both systolic and diastolic
     pressures. This accurate determination is provided by the present
     invention and is described in conjunction with FIGS. 3 and 4 above.
<BR><BR>The applicant has found that the mean arterial pressure is best measured at
     a cuff pressure less than the patient's diastolic pressure. At a pressure
     less than the patient's diastolic pressure, the cuff 10 and transducer 16
     are utilized primarily as sensing devices to pick up the pulsation signal
     of the patient's arteries. When using a pressure-sensing or pulsation
     sensing device, such as an ultrasonic or optical transducer to pick up and
     record the arterial pulse signals, it is expected that one will achieve
     the same correlations between the pressure determination deflection point,
     the apex point, and the nadir point as are achieved through the use of a
     cuff 10 device. The similarity of these correlations permits a cuffless
     blood pressure measuring device to be utilized to provide accurate
     determinations of the patient's mean arterial pressure, so long as the
     patient's systolic and diastolic pressures are obtained by relatively
     accurate measuring devices.
<BR><BR>Another feature of the present invention is that if the practitioner has
     knowledge of the manner in which the mean arterial deflection point, the
     systolic maximum apex point and the diastolic minimum nadir point are
     correlated, it is possible for the practitioner to determine any of the
     three points by knowing only two of the points. For example, if one
     obtains a patient's arterial pulse signal, diastolic pressure and mean
     arterial pressure, the practitioner can then calculate the patient's
     systolic pressure.
<BR><BR>The determination of the patient's mean arterial pressure is a very
     important for enabling the practitioner to treat the patient properly. As
     discussed above, the patient's mean arterial pressure is generally equal
     to the patient's cardiac output times the total peripheral resistance of
     the patient's cardiovascular circulatory system. In controlling a
     patient's hypertension, the practitioner can choose either to control the
     patient's cardiac output by prescribing one type of medicine, or
     controlling the patient's total peripheral resistance by prescribing
     another type of medicine. It is important for a practitioner prescribing
     such medicine to have an accurate reading of the patient's mean arterial
     pressure to determine the correct dosages of such medicine to administer.
<BR><BR>4. Fourth Mode. FIG. 7 comprises a graphic display showing the present
     invention's fourth mode wherein data relating to arterial pulse wave forms
     is displayed as a function of time. The primary purpose of the fourth mode
     is to gather information about the condition of the patient's
     cardiovascular system, rather than determining the patient's blood
     pressure. Three curves are drawn on FIGS. 7 and 7A.
<BR><BR>In FIG. 7, the first curve 240 comprises a series of data points connected
     together by the curve 240. The data points correspond to an arterial
     pressure pulse signal which, in the instant example, is measured at a cuff
     pressure greater than the patient's systolic pressure. The second curve,
     first derivative curve 244, is a curve comprising the first derivative of
     the arterial pulse signal curve 240. The third curve 248 comprises the
     integration of the arterial pressure pulse signal curve 240 over the
     duration of the portion of curve 240 shown in the graph.
<BR><BR>FIG. 7A contains three similar curves including an arterial pressure pulse
     signal curve 250, a derivative curve 252 which is the first derivative of
     arterial pressure curve 250, and an integration curve 254 which is an
     integration of the arterial pressure curve 250. FIG. 7 displays arterial
     pulse wave forms for a person with a normal cardiovascular condition,
     whereas FIG. 7A displays arterial pulse wave forms of a patient exhibiting
     hypertension. The patient whose arterial pulse wave forms are shown in
     FIG. 7A was found to have a measured systolic pressure of 158 mm Hg, a
     diastolic pressure of 80 mm Hg, and a mean arterial pressure of 105 mm Hg.
     As will be appreciated by those skilled in the medical art, a systolic
     pressure of 158 mm Hg is above normal.
<BR><BR>It should also be noted that although the information shown in FIGS. 7 and
     7A were obtained during a "test" wherein the cuff pressure was decreasing
     over time, this need not be the case. It is possible to obtain the
     information neded for the invention's fourth and fifth modes by
     maintaining a constant cuff pressure.
<BR><BR>Comparing FIGS. 7 and 7A, one will note that several differences exist
     between curves 240,244,248 and curves 250,252,254. These differences are
     indicative of the hypertensive condition of the patient of FIG. 7A. The
     first difference between the two sets of curves is that the curves
     250,252,254 of the hypertensive patient (FIG. 7A) are noisier than the
     curves 240,244,248 of the normal patient (FIG. 7). A second difference
     between the two sets of curves is that the arterial pressure pulse curve
     250 of the hypertensive patient includes splits or dips such as at 256.
     These splits or dips 256 are absent in the arterial pulse pressure signal
     curve 240 of the normal patient. These splits or dips 256 are also
     reflected in the first derivative curve 252 of the hypertensive patient as
     deflection points 258 in the first derivative curve 252. The third
     difference between the two curves is that in the arterial pulse curve 250
     of the hypertensive patient, the "diastolic" portion of the curve in each
     cycle from data point 260 to data point 262 rises to a higher level than
     the corresponding diastolic portion (from point 264 to point 266) of the
     arterial pulse curve 240 of the normal patient.
<BR><BR>Several reasons exist for utilizing arterial pulse curves which are taken
     at a cuff pressure above the patient's systolic pressure. One reason for
     using a suprasystolic cuff pressure is that when the cuff pressure is
     greater than the systolic pressure, the patient's arterial vessels in the
     arm are blocked at the cuff 10 location. With such blockage, the blood
     vessels work as a signal transfer line which transmit pressure signals
     from the heart to the aorta, and through the arterial blood vessels to the
     cuff 10, which then picks up the vibration signals. Although a vessel
     filled with blood is not a perfect vibration-conducting medium, the
     information so obtained should be qualitatively representative of the
     aorta pressure curve, which heretofore could only be measured by invasive
     blood pressure determining means. Additionally, the information so
     obtained should also reflect other influences such as the characteristics
     of the arterial vessels and the cuff 10-to-blood-vessel coupling effects.
<BR><BR>Although an interpretation of the wave forms shown in FIGS. 7 and 7A is
     very difficult, the wave forms of FIGS. 7 and 7A are useful to the
     practitioner when compared to similar prior data from the same patient.
     When compared to such a prior data, the information of FIGS. 7 and 7A can
     provide the practitioner with important information about the condition of
     the patient's cardiovascular system, such as the deterioration of the
     patient's heart, aortic valve noises, and changes in blood flow due to
     changes in the patient's blood vessels.
<BR><BR>Additional information is provided by the first derivative curves 244,252.
     The first derivative curves 244,252 display the change of slope of
     arterial pressure curves 240,250, respectively. As such, the first
     derivative curves 244,252 are generally more sensitive to the presence of
     low level noises. A display of these low level noises can be used by the
     practitioner to help better diagnose noises associated with certain
     cardiovascular problems. For example, in FIG. 7A many of the small
     oscillation noises present in the arterial pulse pressure curve 250 are
     better displayed on the first derivative curve 252. Examples of these
     small oscillations are splits 256 which are better displayed as deflection
     points 258 on the first derivative curve 252.
<BR><BR>The integration pressure curves 248,254 are the summation of the pressure
     signal data from the data collected at the beginning (left) of the graph
     to the last point collected and displayed on the graph. Thus, the
     information displayed by the integration curves 248,254 relates to the
     total accumulated arterial pressure multiplied by time over the course of
     the display. Since the information displayed in FIGS. 7 and 7A was
     obtained at pressures above systolic pressure, no blood flowed through the
     body part in area of the cuff 10. The integration of each pulse therefore
     provides information about the strength of each stroke of the heart.
     Although the integration curves 248,254 are difficult to interpret by
     themselves, they are useful to the practitioner when used in conjunction
     with similar integration curves taken from the patient at an earlier date,
     to provide information to the practitioner about the condition of the
     patient's cardiovascular system.
<BR><BR>5. Fifth Mode. The graphic displays shown in FIGS. 8 and 8A set forth data
     presented by the invention in its fifth mode. FIGS. 8 and 8A are similar
     to FIGS. 7 and 7A in that both sets of figures show arterial pulse wave
     forms as a function of time, and are utilized primarily to provide
     information about the condition of the patient's cardiovascular condition
     rather than for determining blood pressure.
<BR><BR>Additionally, both sets of figures contain three curves. FIGS. 8 and 8A
     each include arterial pressure pulse curves 300,302, first derivative
     curves 304,306, and integration curves 308,310. The primary difference
     between FIGS. 7 and 7A and FIGS. 8 and 8A is that FIGS. 7 and 7A display
     information obtained at cuff pressures above the patient's systolic
     pressure, whereas FIGS. 8 and 8A display information obtained at cuff
     pressures below the patient's diastolic pressure.
<BR><BR>FIG. 8 presents information taken from a male patient having normal blood
     pressure, and FIG. 8A presents information taken from a male person
     exhibiting hypertension. Several major differences exist between the
     curves 300,304,308 of the normal person (FIG. 8) and the curves
     302,306,310 of the hypertensive person (FIG. 8A). First, it will be
     noticed that more high frequency noises are present on the arterial pulse
     pressure curve 302 of the hypertensive patient. Examples of such high
     frequency noises are best shown at points 311,313 of the first derivative
     curve 306 of FIG. 8A.
<BR><BR>A second difference is the presence of "splits" at the apex of the arterial
     pulse pressure curve 302 of the hypertensive patient. Although no splits
     are visible on the arterial pulse pressure curve 302 of the hypertensive
     patient, deflection points 312 on the first derivative curve clearly
     indicate the presence of such splits. A third difference is that the
     hypertensive curve exhibits significant increases in the diastolic portion
     of the curve, between points 314,316, similar to the significant increase
     shown in the diastolic portions of the arterial pulse curve 250 between
     points 260 and 262 of FIG. 7A.
<BR><BR>The information displayed in the fifth mode is similar to the information
     displayed in the fourth mode of the present invention. The primary
     difference between the information displayed results from the fact that in
     the fourth mode (FIGS. 7 and 7A) the cuff pressure at which the
     information is taken is above the patient's systolic pressure. Therefore,
     in the fourth mode, no blood is flowing past the cuff 10 picking up the
     signals. In the fifth mode, however, the restrictions on the flow of blood
     caused by the cuff 10 are minimal so that blood can flow through the area
     freely.
<BR><BR>Theoretically, in the fourth mode (above systolic pressure) with no blood
     flowing, the cuff 10 measures the strength of the heart stroke which sends
     out a pressure signal to the cuff 10, whereas in the fifth mode (below
     diastolic pressure) the cuff 10 measures the oscillations of the arterial
     circulation system caused by the pressure wave emanating from the heart
     stroke on the arm where the cuff 10 is placed. Generally, therefore, the
     fourth mode, with no blood flowing, provides information about the
     strength of the heart contraction. The fifth mode, with the blood flowing
     without restriction, gives information to the practitioner about the flow
     of blood in the circulatory system. Information about the strength of the
     heart and the amount of blood flow in the cardiovascular system relate
     directly to the cardiac output and the resistance of the cardiovascular
     circulatory system respectively. As discussed above, information about
     cardiac output and the resistance of the cardiovascular system are
     essential to the practitioner in the diagnosis and treatment of patients
     having hypertension.
<BR><BR>Although the invention has been described in detail with reference to the
     illustrated preferred embodiments, variations and modifications exist
     within the scope and spirit of the invention as described and as defined
     in the following claims:
