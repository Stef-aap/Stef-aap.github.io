<BR><CENTER><B>Abstract</B></CENTER>
<P>A blood pressure cuff is applied about a subject's artery, and inflated
     above the systolic level thus fully occluding the artery for a full heart
     cycle. The cuff pressure is thereafter reduced to permit an increasing
     flow through the progressively less occluded artery, and a measure of the
     peak amplitudes of the successively encountered blood pressure
     (oscillatory complex) pulses stored in memory. Also retained is the cuff
     pressure obtaining for each stored complex peak. In accordance with
     varying aspects of the present invention, the stored complex
     peak-representing data ensemble is corrected for aberrations; and improved
     data processing operates on the stored (and advantageously corrected)
     pulse peak data and the corresponding cuff pressure information to
     determine the subject's systolic arterial blood pressure.

<BR><BR>FIELD OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>This invention relates to automated blood pressure measuring apparatus and,
     more particularly, to stored program controlled monitors employing the
     oscillometric method of detection characterized by data purification and
     enhanced systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure determination.
<BR><BR>CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
<BR><BR>Reference is hereby made to the following concurrently filed co-pending
     commonly assigned patent applications: IMPROVED SPHYGMOMANOMETRIC CUFF
     PRESSURIZING SYSTEM. Ramsey et al. Ser. No. 751,835; IMPROVED AUTOMATED
     MEAN ARTERIAL BLOOD PRESSURE MONITOR WITH DATA ENHANCEMENT. Ramsey et al.
     Ser. No. 751,826; IMPROVED AUTOMATED DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE MONITOR WITH
     DATA ENHANCEMENT. Ramsey et al. Ser. No. 751,825.
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>Automated blood pressure monitoring has rapidly become an accepted and, in
     many cases, essential aspect of human and veterinary treatment. Such
     monitors are now a conventional part of the patient environment in
     emergency rooms, intensive and critical care units, and in the operating
     theatre.
<BR><BR>The so-called oscillometric method of measuring blood pressure is one of
     the most popular methods in commercially available systems. This method
     relies on measuring changes in arterial counterpressure, such as imposed
     by an inflatable cuff, which is controllably relaxed or inflated. In some
     cases the cuff pressure change is continuous, and in others it is
     incremental. In substantially all, a transducer monitors arterial
     counterpressure oscillations, and processing apparatus converts select
     parameters of these oscillations into blood pressure data.
<BR><BR>Of particular interest with respect to the principles of the present
     invention are the concepts set forth in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,360,029 and
     4,394,034 to M. Ramsey, III, which are commonly assigned with the instant
     invention. The Ramsey patents derive from common parentage, the former
     including apparatus claims and the latter including method claims, their
     division having been made in response to a restriction requirement during
     the prosecution. Both patents, however, carry common disclosures of
     apparatus and methods for artifact rejection in oscillometric systems,
     which have been in practice in the commercially successful DINAMAP brand
     monitors, which are manufactured and marketed by Critikon, Inc., of Tampa,
     Fla., the assignee hereof. In accordance with the Ramsey patents, an
     inflatable cuff is suitably located on the limb of a patient, and is
     pumped up to a predetermined pressure. Thereupon, the cuff pressure is
     reduced in predetermined fixed decrements, at each level of which pressure
     fluctuations are monitored. These typically consist of a DC voltage with a
     small superimposed variational component caused by arterial blood pressure
     pulsations (referred to herein as "oscillatory complexes"). Therefore,
     after suitable filtering to reject the DC component and to provide
     amplification, pulse peak amplitudes above a given threshold are measured
     and stored. As the decrementing continues, the peak amplitudes will
     normally increase from a lower amount to a relative maximum, and
     thereafter will decrease. The lowest cuff pressure at which the
     oscillations have a maximum peak value is representative of mean arterial
     pressure. The cuff pressures obtaining when stored oscillatory complex
     pulse peak amplitudes bear predetermined fractional relationships with the
     largest stored peak corresponding to the subject's systolic and diastolic
     pressures.
<BR><BR>The Ramsey patents devote considerable effort and disclosure to the
     rejection of artifact data to derive accurate blood pressure data. Indeed,
     as is apparent from FIG. 2 of the Ramsey patents, the most substantial
     portion of the measurement cycle (denominated "T3") is devoted to the
     execution of complex detection at the various pressure levels, measurement
     of signal peaks of true complexes, and processing those peaks in
     accordance with artifact rejection algorithms. Notwithstanding such
     efforts, the signal peak data collected sometimes incorporates data
     errors, i.e., a data pattern inconsistent with the above described typical
     physiological response pattern of a subject as the artery occluding cuff
     pressure monotonically decreases.
<BR><BR>Further, in a contemporaneous invention (see M. Ramsey III, et al patent
     application Ser. No. 751,835 for "OSCILLOMETRIC BLOOD PRESSURE MONITOR
     EMPLOYING NON-UNIFORM PRESSURE DECREMENTING STEPS" filed on even date
     herewith, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference)
     oscillometric blood pressure measurements are effected with non-uniform
     cuff pressure-dependent pressure decrements between successive oscillatory
     complex peak measuring intervals. Such a method of effecting oscillometric
     blood pressure measurements is facilitated by systolic, diastolic and mean
     blood pressure determining algorithms not heretofore employed.
<BR><BR>It is an object of the present invention to provide improved oscillometric
     blood pressure determining apparatus and methodology.
<BR><BR>More specifically, it is an object of the present invention to purify the
     oscillatory complex peak amplitude data ensemble employed for blood
     pressure determination.
<BR><BR>Yet another object of the present invention is the provision of improved
     algorithms, methodology and apparatus for determining systolic, diastolic
     and mean arterial blood pressure.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>A blood pressure cuff is applied about a subject's artery, and inflated
     above the systolic level thus fully occluding the artery for a full heart
     cycle. The cuff pressure is thereafter reduced to permit an increasing
     flow through the progressively less occluded artery, and a measure of the
     peak amplitudes of the successively encountered oscillatory complexes
     stored in memory. Also retained is the cuff pressure obtaining for each
     stored complex peak.
<BR><BR>In accordance with varying aspects of the present invention, the stored
     complex peak-representing data set is corrected for aberrations; and
     improved data processing operates on the stored (and advantageously
     corrected) pulse peak data and the corresponding cuff pressure information
     to determine the subject's systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure.

<BR><BR>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,360,029 and 4,349,034, each to Maynard Ramsey III, and
     Maynard Ramsey, III et al U.S. Pat. No. 4,543,962 for "IMPROVED METHOD OF
     AUTOMATED BLOOD PRESSURE DETECTION" issued Oct. 1, 1985 are incorporated
     herein by reference, as is the aforementioned co-filed Ramsey III et al
     application. These patents and patent applications describe in detail the
     basic oscillometric method of measuring blood pressure forming a
     background and a starting point for the instant invention.
<BR><BR>To review only briefly, an artery-occluding cuff is disposed on the
     subject, e.g., about a subject's upper arm over the brachial artery. At
     the inception of a measuring cycle, the cuff is inflated to a pressure
     which fully occludes the brachial artery, i.e., prevents blood from
     flowing therethrough at any point in the heart cycle. The cuff is then
     progressively deflated, as in discrete steps. A pressure transducer is
     coupled to the internal cuff pressure and provides an analog signal
     characterizing the blood pressure oscillatory complexes when they begin to
     occur (i.e., when the maximum heart pressure corresponding to contraction
     of the heart's left ventricle exceeds the instantaneously obtaining
     artery-occluding cuff pressure). The peak values of the complex signals
     are determined in hardware or software.
<BR><BR>As the measurement cycle progresses, the peak amplitude of the blood
     pressure complexes generally become monotonically larger to a maximum and
     then become monotonically smaller as the cuff pressure continues toward
     deflation. The peak amplitude of the cuff pressure oscillation complexes,
     and the corresponding occluding-cuff pressure values are retained in
     computer memory. The aforementioned Ramsey patents and patent applications
     illustrate previously employed algorithms for processing the stored blood
     pressure complex peak values and concomitant pressure values to yield the
     subject's mean arterial pressure. These patents and applications also
     furnish detailed procedures for measuring oscillatory complex peaks;
     procedures for testing complexes and rejecting bad data associated with
     measurement-impeding artifacts (such as motion) during a measuring cycle,
     and the like.
<BR><BR>The oscillometric blood pressure measurements as typified by the
     aforementioned Ramsey disclosures are effected under stored program
     control, as via a microprocessor operative in conjunction with a program
     containing read only memory (ROM or PROM), and a variable content random
     access memory (RAM) which stores the cuff pressures, oscillatory complex
     peak amplitudes, and other processing operand variables. The
     microprocessor receives the cuff pressure readings generated by the
     pressure transducer, for example as processed by a peak detector,
     amplifier and analog-to-digital converter, and supplies all output control
     signals required, e.g., to open and close one or more cuff deflating
     valves.
<BR><BR>The oscillometric method above described and more fully discussed in the
     aforementioned Ramsey patents and applications may be conducted with
     several variations. Thus, for example, the cuff may be inflated directly
     by an air pump; and deflated in fixed, discrete steps under microprocessor
     control. Alternatively, the cuff may be principally or entirely inflated
     by the pressurized contents of an air reservoir; and/or deflation may
     proceed in variable, cuff pressure-dependent steps via selected one or
     ones of plural deflating valves. These latter alternatives achieve the
     desideratum of condensing the time required for a composite measurement
     cycle of operation.
<BR><BR>Also, there are alternative procedures for measuring the oscillatory
     complex peak amplitude at any prevailing cuff pressure. In one mode
     heretofore employed, plural (e.g., two) complex peaks are measured at each
     cuff pressure step during cuff deflation, and their average used as the
     peak value. Since the peaks should be approximately equal, any marked
     disparity (e.g., &gt;20%) signals that some artifact error occurred and the
     data is rejected. In a fast ("stat") mode, after several intervals of
     qualifying (close or equal peak values) companion complexes are detected
     to develop measurement confidence, only one pulse is required during
     succeeding cuff deflation intervals thus speeding the composite
     measurement period. Please see in this later regard the aforementioned
     application filed Jul. 9, 1984.
<BR><BR>As alluded to above, it is sometimes the case when blood pressure complexes
     are being examined for peak amplitude at any occluding pressure level that
     improper data is developed. There are varying causes for such aberrations.
     Perhaps the most common is spurious motion by the subject which generates
     an inadvertent pressure impulse in the cuff which is sensed by the
     pressure transducer which may be then incorrectly reflected in the blood
     pressure measurement. Other causes include varying sources of interfering
     electrical noise or internal cardiac or respiratory changes in the
     subject. When a false complex peak amplitude value is generated, it is
     discarded by the composite measuring apparatus and a discard-signalling
     value (e.g., +1) retained in its place in memory.
<BR><BR>A second form of spurious data occurs when the pattern of stored pulse peak
     values departs from the physiologically mandated sequence of values which
     progressively increase to a peak and then progressively decrease.
<BR><BR>Attention will now be directed to data processing under stored program
     control for purifying the data collected by the above-described blood
     pressure measuring apparatus. Further, specific illustrative efficient
     algorithms are discussed for in fact determining the subject's systolic,
     diastolic and mean arterial blood pressures. Such data processing may be
     effected on any computing equipment, preferably digital microprocessors
     such as commercially available from a number of vendors. The program
     instructions and sequences presented below are for illustrative purposes
     only. Such instructions may in fact be implemented in any of diverse
     program languages and sequences readily apparent to those skilled in the
     art. In the signal processing below discussed, processing variables have
     the following significance:

</PRE>
<BR><BR>Turning now to FIG. 1, there is depicted wave forms with associated data
     characterizing the generation of data for an oscillatory blood pressure
     measurement--and purging (overcoming) bad data constituents. In accordance
     with the above discussion, the cuff artery occluding pressure for a
     measurement cycle, as measured by the cuff-associated transducer, is
     characterized by a wave form 10. The cuff pressure rapidly increases to a
     maximum above the subject's systolic pressure, and is then deflated in a
     sequence of steps to a point below the diastolic pressure. The sequence of
     cuff deflation steps is indicated by the time interval signalling digits
     1,2, . . . , (lowest row 18 in the data table portion of FIG. 1). The
     internal pressure characterizing the cuff pressure at each step i is given
     by the data array CP(1),CP(2), . . . (upper data table row 12).
<BR><BR>Each step (time interval) is made sufficiently long to include at least two
     heart beats. Accordingly, at least two cuff pressure complex pulses 21 and
     22 are measured during each interval after such pulses begin. Legend have
     been applied to pulses occurring during deflation steps 6 and 9 to avoid
     clutter and loss of clarity in FIG. 1. No pulses are measured during the
     first and second pressure steps (time intervals), it being assumed that
     the cuff pressure [CP(1)=201 Torr., and CP(2)=194 Torr.] are sufficient
     during these periods to obviate blood flow through the subject's artery
     for the full heart cycle. During the following intervals 3,4 . . . , two
     oscillometric complex pulses 21 and 22 are generated and measured, the two
     pulses having an average peak amplitude 23 (the processor variable array
     value initially stored in .PHI.A(I)). The measured oscillation amplitude
     array (.PHI.A(I)) is shown in the second row 14 of the FIG. 1 data table
     for each time interval.
<BR><BR>As above noted, assuming a perfect measurement, the oscillation pressure
     amplitude .PHI.A(I) data row would not contain any +1 values which signify
     an impeded measurement. Further, the data pattern in the second row of the
     data table for the oscillation amplitudes would exhibit a pattern of
     successively increasing numbers to a peak value, followed by progressively
     decreasing values--all without adjacent equal .PHI.A(I) values. To the
     extent that any .PHI.A(I)=1 values are stored, or to the extent that the
     progressively increasing/decreasing pattern does not obtain, the data
     processing in accordance with the instant invention functions to compute
     appropriate corrected .PHI.A(I) values (the third data table row 15 in
     FIG. 1) for the oscillation amplitude entries requiring correction.
<BR><BR>In overview, where any .PHI.A(I)=1 values exist, they are replaced by the
     average value of the oscillation amplitude in the two contiguous storage
     cells, i.e.,
<BR><BR>.PHI.A(I)=(.PHI.A(I-1)+.PHI.A(I+1))/2.                     1
<BR><BR>Correspondingly, where two contiguous oscillation amplitudes have the
     proscribed equal values, the first of the contiguous equal pair is
     replaced by the average of the amplitudes of the complex peaks measured at
     the next lower and next higher occluding cuff pressures. See, for example,
     Eq. 1 and, more particularly, the comparable relationship in functional
     block 30 of FIG. 2.
<BR><BR>Data flow effecting the data purification algorithm above-discussed is set
     forth in the program flow chart of FIG. 2. FIG. 2 operates on the measured
     average oscillation amplitudes (the second data table row 14 in FIG. 1)
     and generates the corrected .PHI.A(I) values shown in the third row 15 of
     FIG. 1. To this end, proceeding from a start block 10 (FIG. 2), step 15
     reads the next value .PHI.A(I) (proceeding toward the right along the FIG.
     1 data table row 14) and test 18 determines whether the value stored in
     .PHI.A(I) equals the error-signalling value +1. If as is the usual case it
     does not (indicating that the value measured was presumptively free of
     artifacts and the like), control passes to equality test 27. However, if
     the contents of .PHI.A(I) did equal +1 ("YES" branch of test 18),
     functional block 23 implements Eq. 1, i.e., replaces the +1 former
     contents of memory cell .PHI.A(I) corresponding to cuff pressure CP(I)
     with the average value of the oscillation amplitude measured at the next
     lower (.PHI.A(I-1)) and next higher non-plus one (.PHI.A(I+1)) deflation
     steps. The processing steps 18 and 23 thus purge the measured pressure
     peak amplitude storage contents (the second row of the FIG. 1 data table)
     of all +1 values, replacing these by the average value of the measurements
     made during immediately adjacent deflation steps (corrected .PHI.A(I)
     contents being illustrated in row 15).
<BR><BR>Test 27 next examines the current operand .PHI.A(I) for the proscribed
     equality with the previous value .PHI.A(I-1). If, as is normally the case,
     the contents of .PHI.A(I) and .PHI.A(I-1) differ ("NO" branch from test
     27), processing flows to test 32 to determine whether each of the N
     elements of .PHI.A(I) have been processed. If they have not, control
     returns to block 15 to read in and process the next .PHI.A(I) element of
     the array in the third row 15 of the FIG. 1 data table. When all elements
     have been processed, control exits from the FIG. 2 data purification
     routine to data processing point 33 to proceed with the next (unrelated)
     task for the microprocessor.
<BR><BR>If a data error has occurred ("YES" output of test 27 signalling that a
     data value .PHI.A(I) equaled the previous value), control passes to step
     30 which replaces the assumed erroneous element .PHI.A(I-1)--(the value
     which should differ from .PHI.A(I) but did not) with the average of the
     two immediately contiguous elements as by
<BR><BR>.PHI.A(I-1)=(.PHI.A(I)+.PHI.A(I-2))/2.                     2
<BR><BR>Accordingly, the data purification routine depicted in FIG. 2 and
     above-discussed replaces all error reading signifying .PHI.A(I)=1 values
     with an interpolated estimated value; and purges the data table row 14
     .PHI.A(I) array of data of any contiguous equal values. The corrected set
     of .PHI.A(I) is shown in the third row 15 of the FIG. 1 data table. Thus,
     for example, the oscillation amplitude value during the cuff pressure step
     (time interval) "4" is corrected from the error-signalling +1 value to a
     peak amplitude 14, representing the average of measurements 4 and 25 at
     cuff pressures 187 Torr. and 153 Torr. during the immediately contiguous
     time intervals 3 and 5. Similarly, the first (pressure step 6) of two
     equal measured oscillation amplitude pulses of value 63 during periods 6
     and 7, corresponding to occluding cuff pressures of 140 Torr. and 128
     Torr., is corrected to a value of 44 representing the average of the
     contiguous measured amplitudes of 63 and 25 units.
<BR><BR>The corrected array .PHI.A(I) as represented by the third row 15 in FIG. 1
     thus comprises value from which each of the systolic, diastolic and mean
     arterial blood pressures may be determined either in accordance with the
     improved algorithms below discussed or employing the algorithms of the
     above referenced patents and patent applications. The data purification
     above discussed provides more accurate measurements than was heretofore
     the case; and also permits blood pressures to be determined more quickly,
     obviating the need for repeated deflation steps when unacceptable artifact
     or noise corrupted data is sensed.
<BR><BR>Attention will now be shifted to the particular method pursuant to which
     the stored cuff pressure CP(I) and corrected blood pressure peak value
     .PHI.A(I) information in the first and third data rows of FIG. 1 is
     employed in accordance with other aspects of the present invention to
     measure a subject's systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressures.
<BR><BR>pulse complex wave form processing typifying systolic blood pressure
     determination is illustrated in FIG. 3, and a flow chart for the
     underlying data processing is set forth in FIG. 4. In overview, systolic
     pressure is determined by:
<BR><BR>(a) Finding the amplitude (.PHI.A(MAX)) of the largest blood pressure
     oscillatory complex (which occurs at the time interval MAX);
<BR><BR>(b) Finding an amplitude level (LVL) equal to a predetermined fraction of
     the peak value .PHI.A(MAX). We have found a value of 0.5 to be
     satisfactory for normal processing with something less (e.g., 0.45) for
     stat (rapid deflation and/or single pulse) operation;
<BR><BR>(c) Examining the corrected oscillation amplitude (.PHI.A(I)) values (third
     row 15 in the FIG. 1 data table) starting at the MAX interval and
     proceeding toward the higher cuff pressure direction (i.e., to the left in
     FIGS. 1 and 3) to find the two contiguous oscillation amplitudes for which
<BR><BR>.PHI.A(L).epsilon.MAX*0.5&lt;.PHI.A(L+1);                     3
<BR><BR>(d) Computing the interpolated cuff pressure (between CP(L) and CP(L+1))
     assuming a linear variance in oscillation amplitude and cuff pressure
     between the intervals L and L+1. This per se well known linear trapezoidal
     interpolation is graphically depicted in FIG. 5, The interpolated cuff
     pressure directly corresponds to the subject's systolic blood pressure
     (SYS). Expanding upon the systolic pressure determining methodology set
     forth above, the cuff pressure interval I=MAX when the largest oscillation
     amplitude peak occurs is determined in any per se well known manner, (step
     40 of the FIG. 4 flow chart corresponding to the interval MAX in FIG. 3).
<BR><BR>Thus, for example, the following schematic BASIC sequence will suffice as
     illustrative to find the interval MAX:
<BR><BR>.PHI.AMAX=.PHI.A(1)                                        4
<BR><BR>MAX=1                                                      5
<BR><BR>FOR K=2 TO N                                               6
<BR><BR>IF .PHI.A(K)&lt;.PHI.AMAX GOTO 70                             7
<BR><BR>.PHI.AMAX=.PHI.A(K)                                        8
<BR><BR>MAX=K                                                      9
<BR><BR>70 NEXT K                                                  10
<BR><BR>In brief, Equations 4 and 5 make an initial assumption that the peak value
     occurred during the first interval and load a provisional peak value
     storing variable OAMAX with the value .PHI.A(1). For an assumed N-time
     interval measurement, the loop between Equations 6 and 10 sequentially
     examines every element of the .PHI.A(I) array from 2 to N, updating
     .PHI.AMAX only when the value .PHI.A(K)--(K being the loop index) exceeds
     the previously assumed .PHI.AMAX value. When the processing exits from the
     loop following instruction 70 in Equation 10 the variable MAX contains the
     value of I such that .PHI.A(MAX) is the largest value in the array.
<BR><BR>The next following step 42 sets a variable LVL equal to the predetermined
     fraction of the peak amplitude .PHI.A(MAX) as by
<BR><BR>LVL=.PHI.A(MAX)*0.5.                                       11
<BR><BR>The value LVL is shown by the dashed line 50 in FIG. 3.
<BR><BR>The next following operation 45 finds the first time interval (L) preceding
     MAX for which the oscillation amplitude peak is less than LVL, i.e., less
     than one-half of the peak value .PHI.A(MAX). thereby finding the two
     contiguous values (L, L+1) having peak amplitudes which bound the value in
     LVL. Algorithms for conducting such a search are well known to those
     skilled in the art, e.g.,
<BR><BR>FOR J=1 TO MAX                                             12
<BR><BR>IF (.PHI.A(MAX-J)-LVL)&lt;O GOTO 140                          13
<BR><BR>NEXT J                                                     14
<BR><BR>140 L=MAX-J                                                15
<BR><BR>Equations 12-15 simply comprise a DO or FOR-NEXT loop progressing from
     MAX-1 toward L=1, exiting when the first sub-LVL value is obtained. The
     appropriate interval identification (MAX-J) is stored in the variable
     location L.
<BR><BR>Finally, the value of the systolic pressure is estimated by assuming a
     linear variation in cuff pressure between the values CP(L) and CP(L+1),
     and a linear variation between the corresponding oscillation amplitude
     .PHI.A(L) and .PHI.A(L+1). Thus, in accordance with the per se well known
     trapezoidal interpolation equation, the systolic pressure SYS may be
     determined (step 47 of FIG. 4) by
     ##EQU1##
<BR><BR>To illustrate employing the data of FIG. 1, 50% of the peak amplitude (70)
     is 35, and thus the pulse complex measurements of time intervals 5 and 6
     are selected for systolic pressure computation. The Eq. 16 software
     interpolation implementation yields:
     ##EQU2##
     assuming three significant figures.
<BR><BR>Pulse complex wave form processing characterizing diastolic blood pressure
     determination is illustrated in FIG. 6; and a flow chart for the
     underlying diastolic data processing algorithm is depicted in FIG. 7. In
     overview, diastolic pressure is determined by:
<BR><BR>(a) the amplitude (.PHI.A(MAX)) of the complex (which occurs at the time
     interval MAX);
<BR><BR>(b) Finding an amplitude level (UDLVL) equal to a first predetermined
     fraction of the peak value .PHI.A(MAX). We have found a value of 0.69 to
     be satisfactory for normal processing and 0.72 for rapid ("stat")
     processing;
<BR><BR>(c) Examining the corrected oscillation amplitude (.PHI.A(I)) buffer 15
     (FIG. 1) starting at the MAX interval and proceeding toward the lower cuff
     pressure direction (i.e. to the right in FIGS. 1 and 6) to find the two
     contiguous oscillation amplitudes for which
<BR><BR>.PHI.A(UD).ltoreq.MAX*0.69.ltoreq..PHI.A(UD-1);            19
<BR><BR>(d) Finding the interpolated cuff pressure (between CP(UD-1) and CP(UD))
     assuming a linear variation in oscillation amplitude and cuff pressure
     between the intervals UD-1 and UD (processing variable DIAU in FIG. 7);
<BR><BR>(e) Examining the stored .PHI.A(I) oscillation amplitude values at
     pressures starting at the lowest CP measured for a contiguous pair
     bounding the peak amplitude .PHI.A(MAX) multiplied by a second factor
     lower than the first factor (e.g., 0.55), i.e., where
<BR><BR>.PHI.A(LD).ltoreq.MAX*0.55.ltoreq..PHI.(LD-1);             20
<BR><BR>(f) Computing the interpolated cuff pressure between CP(LD) and CP(LD-1)
     corresponding to MAX times the 0.55 factor. This lower interpolated cuff
     pressure is associated with the variable designation DIAL; and
<BR><BR>(g) Determining the subject's diastolic pressure (DIA) as the average of
     the upper and lower interpolated values DIAU and DIAL, i.e.,
<BR><BR>DIA=(DIAU+DIAL)/2                                          21
<BR><BR>The above-described procedure is illustrated in the blood pressure complex
     depiction of FIG. 6 and the FIG. 7 flow chart. The peak .PHI.A(MAX) is
     first located as by the processing of Equations 4-10. The upper and lower
     peak amplitude fractions DIAU and DIAL are next determined (steps 64 and
     65 of FIG. 7 corresponding to the labeled horizontal dash lines in FIG.
     6). Step 69 then finds the first time interval (UD) following MAX at which
     the peak amplitude .PHI.A(UD) is lower than the value stored in DIAU (as
     by processing analogous to that of Equations 12 through 15 replacing
     "MAX-J" with "MAX+J"). Thereafter, step 72 performs the trapezoidal
     interpolation analogous to that of FIG. 5, determining the cuff pressure
     (DIAU) corresponding to the UDLVL complex amplitude value. It is observed
     that the time interval UD-1 coincides with the interval MAX when the peak
     complex value occurred since, for the data case illustrated, the first
     pulse complex following MAX less than 0.69.times..PHI.A(MAX) occurred in
     the next time interval MAX+1.
<BR><BR>The functional steps 73 and 74 of FIG. 7 perform in a manner directly
     analogous to operations 69 and 72, locating the cuff pressure DIAL by
     interpolation for the intervals when the peak complex amplitudes bound the
     LDLVL value equal .PHI.A(MAX) times 0.55. This latter search is conducted
     from .PHI.A(i) at the lowest CP, then working toward higher CP's. Finally,
     the subject's diastolic pressure (DIA) is computed as the average of the
     contents stored in DIAU and DIAL (step 82).
<BR><BR>To illustrate with a numerical example, again employing the data portion of
     FIG. 1,
<BR><BR>DIAU=83+((93-83).times.(48-40))/(40-53)=71.                22
<BR><BR>DIAL=74+(83-74).times.(38-33))/(33-40)=67.                 23
<BR><BR>DIA=(71+67)/2=69.                                          24
<BR><BR>Finally, wave form processing illustrating mean arterial blood pressure
     measurement is shown in FIG. 8, and in flow chart form for the
     corresponding data processing in FIG. 9. In summary, mean arterial
     pressure is determined by:
<BR><BR>(a) Finding the amplitude (.PHI.A(MAX)) of the largest blood complex (which
     occurs at the time interval MAX);
<BR><BR>(b) Examining the cuff pressure values in the corrected register 15 (FIG.
     1) for the interval MNl yielding the first oscillation amplitude less than
     .PHI.A(MAX+1), i.e., the first cuff pressure to the left of the interval
     MAX which was less than the complex peak amplitude .PHI.A(MAX+1) occurring
     in the first interval following the time MAX. This satisfies the
     relationship
<BR><BR>.PHI.A(MNl).ltoreq..PHI.A(MAX+1).ltoreq..PHI.A(MNl+1);     25
<BR><BR>(c) An interpolation is then conducted between the intervals MNl and MNl+1
     for a cuff pressure MAPL corresponding to the oscillation amplitude value
     .PHI.A(MAX+1); and
<BR><BR>(d) Finally, the mean arterial pressure (MAP) is determined by a weighting
     of the cuff pressures CP(MAX+1) and MAPL, as by
<BR><BR>MAP=(CP(MAX+1)+(2*MAPL))/2.9.                              26
<BR><BR>The denominator (2.9 in Eq. 26) may be somewhat lower for operation in a
     "stat" mode, e.g., 2.85.
<BR><BR>The above-discussed algorithm for determining mean arterial pressure is
     illustrated in FIGS. 8 and 9. Step 1011 (FIG. 9) finds the peak interval
     MAX (for example, by execution comparable to Equations 4-10). A processing
     variable AMP is set equal to the peak value .PHI.A(MAX+1) of the complex
     following the interval MAX (step 105) and the interval MNl is next
     determined (step 106) as the first occurring complex less than the value
     AMP (i.e.. .PHI.A(MAX+1)) to the left of time MAX in FIG. 8 (e.g., by
     processing comparable to Equations 12-15). An interpolation is then
     conducted to find the point MAPL (FIG. 8; step 1111 in FIG. 9) and the
     final processing operation 1131 finds the subject's mean arterial pressure
     by implementing Equation 26.
<BR><BR>To again illustrate by numerical example from the FIG. 1 data
<BR><BR>MAPL=140+((128-140).times.(62-44))/(63-44)=129             27
<BR><BR>MAP=(104+2*129)/2.9=124                                    28
<BR><BR>The foregoing discussion has thus demonstrated that measured data may be
     enhanced by replacing data lost through measurement artifacts or the like
     or deviations from a proper data pattern by approximated values. Specific
     data processing algorithms were presented and discussed for the
     computation of a subject's measured systolic, diastolic and mean arterial
     blood pressures.
<BR><BR>Referring to FIG. 10 herein, there is shown an illustrative embodiment of
     the principles of the present invention. The arm 100 of a human subject is
     shown wearing a conventional flexible inflatable and deflatable cuff 101
     for occluding the brachial artery when fully inflated. As the cuff 101 is
     deflated in a manner to be described further below, via air venting
     deflate valve apparatus 102 consisting of first and second deflate valves
     103 and 104, the arterial occlusion is gradually relieved. A pressure
     transducer 105 is coupled by a duct 106 to the cuff 101 and senses the
     pressure therein. In accordance with conventional oscillometric techniques
     pressure oscillations in the artery are sensed by changes in the
     counterpressure of the cuff 101, and in turn by the transducer 105, there
     to be converted to an electrical signal and coupled over path 107 to a
     microprocessor or other controller 108. From the standpoint of the
     principles of the present invention, the processing of the signals from
     pressure transducer 105 by the microprocessor 108 to produce blood
     pressure data, and optionally to reject artifact data can be conducted in
     accordance with the prior art for example in accordance with the teachings
     of the above-referenced Ramsey '029 patent.
<BR><BR>A source of pressurized air 109 is shown connected via a duct 110 through
     an inflate valve 111 and a duct 112 to the pressure cuff 101. The inflate
     valve 111 is electrically controlled through a connection 113 from the
     microprocessor 108.
<BR><BR>The deflate valve apparatus 102 has its valves 103 and 101 connected by
     respective ducts 114 and 115 to a junction with duct 116 which, in turn,
     connects to a branch connection at 117 with the duct 112 leading to cuff
     101. Exhaust connections from deflate valves 103 and 104 are shown.
     Respectively, at 118 and 119. The valves 103 and 104 receive electrical
     control over a path 120 from the microprocessor 108.
<BR><BR>The apparatus disclosed above with reference to FIG. 10. except for the
     plural deflate valves 103 and 104 and the programming of the
     microprocessor 108 herein, can be substantially the same as that disclosed
     in the patent application to M. Ramsey, III et al. which was first
     mentioned above. The structure disclosed in said application incorporates
     a single deflate valve while, as mentioned previously, the subject
     embodiment has two valves, 103 and 104, which valves preferably, but not
     necessarily, differ from one another with regard to orifice size. By way
     of example, valve 103 has a first size orifice and valve 104 has a larger
     size orifice, each valve being electrically actuatable and having a given
     finite response time under the control of microprocessor 108. The details
     of the microprocessor not discussed in said first mentioned patent
     application but necessary for the present invention will be apparent from
     the following discussion of the operation of the apparatus as disclosed
     herein.
<BR><BR>Referring now to the operation of the apparatus illustrated in FIG. 10, it
     can be assumed that air under pressure of about 8-10 p.s.i. is available
     in the source of pressurized air 109. When it is desired to initiate a
     determination of blood pressure, the microprocessor 108 furnishes a signal
     over path 113 to open the inflate valve 111. It is assumed that the
     deflate valve apparatus 102 is closed. Air from the source 109 is
     communicated through valve 111 and duct 112 to inflate the cuff 101 to a
     desired level. Preferably, the microprocessor 108 responds to the signal
     from the pressure transducer 105. indicative of the instantaneous pressure
     in the cuff 101, to interrupt the inflation of the cuff 101 when the
     pressure in the cuff reaches a predetermined value above estimated
     systolic pressure. Such interruption will be accomplished by feeding a
     signal over path 113 to close inflate valve 111. Once valve 111 has been
     closed, the blood pressure measurement can be obtained by commencing the
     deflate routine.
<BR><BR>Actual measurement of the blood pressure under the control of the
     microprocessor 108 and the deflate valve apparatus 102 and as sensed by
     pressure transducer 105 can be accomplished in any suitable manner such as
     that disclosed in said Ramsey, III patents or said above second mentioned
     Ramsey, III et al. patent application. At the completion of each
     measurement cycle, the deflate valve apparatus 102 can be re-opened as
     explained hereinafter long enough to relax the cuff pressure substantially
     completely. Thereafter, the deflate valve apparatus 102 can be closed at
     the start of a new measurement cycle.
<BR><BR>By way of summation, when a blood pressure measurement is desired the
     inflate valve will be opened while the cuff pressure is supervised until
     the cuff pressure reaches the desired level at which time the inflate
     valve will be closed. Thereafter, the deflate valves are operated and the
     measurement taken. The operation of the apparatus that has been discussed
     to this point can be substantially the same as that described in the first
     mentioned patent application. The present invention relates to the
     deflation phase and that operation will now be described.
<BR><BR>Typically, in prior art automatic sphygmomanometric devices, the cuff
     deflation operation has been accomplished in equal decremental steps,
     usually about 5 to 6 Torr, and invariably less than 7 Torr per step.
     However, it has now been discovered that reliable and accurate
     measurements can be obtained even though, contrary to long accepted
     precepts, steps substantially larger than 7 Torr are taken, and even
     though successive steps are of unequal magnitude. Consequently, in
     accordance with the present invention, the cuff deflation-measurement
     procedure is accelerated with a resultant significant reduction in overall
     cycle time. This is illustrated dramatically in FIG. 12 wherein the plot
     130 shows that with equal size decrements on the order of 7 Torr per step,
     a complete cycle takes about 23 seconds. By contrast, the plot 131,
     representing operation of the apparatus embodying the present invention,
     shows completion of a full measuring cycle in less than 13 seconds. While
     the two plots 130 and 131 represent ideal cases wherein artifact has not
     interfered with and prolonged the measurement cycle, the plots do reveal
     the relative time acceleration that can be expected. The principles
     underlying the operation of the present invention are best described with
     reference to the flow chart in FIG. 11 to which attention should now be
     directed. At the commencement of the deflation operation or routine, the
     cuff is deflated by steps of predetermined fixed magnitude, generally
     between 5 and 7 Torr per step, until oscillations are detected and
     validated for the first time. The present example employs steps of 7 Torr
     each. Bearing in mind that the cuff pressure is at an upper level, the
     valve 103 with the smaller orifice is initially employed. For various
     reasons the subject apparatus is usually employed with the transducer 105
     located up to 15 feet or more away from the cuff 101. This distance over
     which cuff pressure must be conducted via duct 106, as well as the
     inherent electro-mechanical limitations of the commonly used deflate
     valves, introduces a significant response time factor into the activation
     of the deflate valve apparatus 102. Therefore, the orifice of valve 103
     must be small enough that the valve can be opened, cause a desired cuff
     pressure decrement, and be re-closed before a cuff pressure drop overshoot
     has occurred.
<BR><BR>So long as the cuff pressure is relatively high the deflation velocity
     through the smaller orifice valve 103 will be high and the time required
     to decrement the pressure the desired step will be relatively short. This
     is reflected by the comparatively steep or substantially vertical step
     decrements 132 at the commencement of plots 130 and 131.
<BR><BR>If the remaining deflation were to be accomplished only with valve 103 and
     with equal steps of 7 Torr each, the time for each decrement would
     increase, with each successive decrement, (because it occurs at a lower
     average pressure). and hence take longer and longer. This is represented
     by the "risers" 133 in plot 130 departing further and further from
     vertical as deflation progresses. The delay in the measurement is actually
     aggravated by the lengthened decrement interval because beyond a certain
     time interval the cuff will still be deflating when the next heart
     oscillation occurs and such oscillation will have to be skipped by the
     measuring apparatus, thus requiring a longer period of sampling at that
     cuff pressure.
<BR><BR>The present invention avoids the above mentioned problem by timing each
     decrement step and by switching over to a larger deflate valve orifice
     whenever the decrement step requires more than 8 milliseconds to deflate 1
     Torr. This is equivalent to a deflation rate of 125 Torr per second. Thus,
     during a deflation routine the present apparatus will at some point switch
     from deflate valve 103 to 104, and, if necessary, make a further switch to
     operation of both valves 103 and 104 in parallel. A typical deflation rate
     at the beginning of the deflation operation is about 200 Torr per second.
     This is equivalent to 5 mSec. per Torr.
<BR><BR>As mentioned above and indicated by the flow chart in FIG. 2, after
     arterial oscillations are detected and verified i.e., oscillation
     amplitude is greater than 0, the microprocessor 108 resorts either to a
     look up table or to an equivalent formula to select a "Base" deflate step
     as a function of the then prevailing cuff pressure sensed by transducer
     105. A typical table relating "Base" deflate step to cuff pressure can be
     constructed in the manner described below. Generally, the "Base" deflate
     steps over the middle range of the deflation procedure are each
     substantially greater than 7 Torr and can be as much as 20 Torr or more,
     particularly when measurements are being made on a subject with
     excessively high blood pressure.
<BR><BR>The flow chart shows, however, an augmentation of the "Base" deflate step
     using the equation:
<BR><BR>Base=Base+PPA/32                                           (1)
<BR><BR>wherein PPA is a quantity directly Proportional to the last detected
     oscillation peak amplitude. For convenience PPA can be replaced by "x",
     and for the purpose of generalization, the divisor "32", a constant unique
     to one specific embodiment, can be represented by the constant "a". The
     augmentation represented by equation (1) is used in the deflation routine
     until the microprocessor 108 has detected the maximum amplitude
     oscillation from the arterial complexes. After detection and verification
     of the maximum amplitude oscillation the decrement equation can be further
     augmented to:
<BR><BR>Base=Base+PPA/32+PPA/32=Base+2(PPA/32).                    (2)
<BR><BR>Operation in accordance with equations (1) and (2) therefore can be
     generalized as follows:
<BR><BR>Base=Base+y(x/a)                                           (3)
<BR><BR>where "Base" and "x" are as defined previously, "y" is equal to one or two,
     and "a" is a constant chosen such that the value of "x/a" over the normal
     range of oscillation amplitudes will vary between zero and about 3.
<BR><BR>During each decrement step, a determination is made of the time required to
     accomplish the decrement and this time is stored to be used during the
     next decrement procedure. Also stored is the last "Base". By obtaining the
     quotient of the two stored quantities (Time/Base) and comparing with the
     preselected rate of 8 mSec./Torr. a determination is made whether to use
     the same (i.e. smaller) deflate valve for the decrement in process or to
     also use the larger orifice deflate valve in combination with the smaller
     valves. The drawings describe this particular scheme of operation for the
     valves.
<BR><BR>The need for augmenting the cuff pressure dependent "Base" step by an
     oscillation amplitude dependent factor is due to two phenomena. First,
     there can occur a large increase in cuff pressure at each heart beat
     resulting from arm expansion momentarily during cardiac systole. Second,
     after the cuff pressure has decreased below that at maximum oscillation
     amplitude, the blood flow passing under the cuff 101 with each cardiac
     systole begins to engage the lower arm, which in turn, causes the pressure
     in the cuff to slowly rise. The net effect of the two phenomena is to
     require additional decrement steps in cuff pressure to deflate the cuff
     below the diastolic pressure level unless the deflate step sizes are
     increased commensurately with the two phenomena just described.
<BR><BR>A look up table relating the "Base" deflate steps to prevailing cuff
     pressure can be constructed arbitrarily on a point by point basis or using
     the following type of equation:
<BR><BR>Base Step=k(CP)                                            (4)
<BR><BR>where "CP"=cuff pressure in Torr and "k" is a constant on the order of 0.1,
     for example.
<BR><BR>Alternatively, when it is desired to place a constraint on the minimum size
     step, the equation can take the form:
<BR><BR>Base Step=k.sub.1 +k.sub.2 (CP)                            (5)
<BR><BR>Where "k.sub.1 " and "k.sub.2 " are constants. Respectively, on the order
     of 4 and 0.05, for example, and "CP" is as defined above.
<BR><BR>It should be understood that equations such as (4) and (5) can be used
     directly to compute the values of Base Step as required during a
     measurement procedure instead of providing a pre-calculated look up table.
     It should also be understood that the value selected for "a" will depend
     upon the proportionality factor between "PPA" and actual oscillation peak
     amplitude.
<BR><BR>Referring to the flow chart of FIG. 11, it will be noted that when the 8
     mSec./Torr decrement interval is exceeded, the NEXT STEP value (i.e., the
     desired new cuff pressure) is increased by "8". This is to ensure against
     overshooting the desired pressure level when first using the larger valve.
<BR><BR>While valves 103 and 104 have been described as having different size
     orifices it is contemplated that equal size valves can be used. In such
     case, the operating routine would be arranged to commence the deflate
     cycle using one valve, with a switch to two valves in parallel when an
     increased flow rate for the particular pressure level is desired. Another
     alternative would be to have a controllable throttling valve operable
     between two or more orifice settings. In any event the deflate valve
     mechanism should have at least two operating modes, one providing a
     greater flow rate than the other for any given applied pressure.
<BR><BR>The above-described arrangements are merely illustrative of the principles
     of the present invention. Numerous modifications and adaptations thereof
     will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art without departing
     from the spirit and scope of the present invention. For example, the
     pressure measurement mode is described above as stepped deflation from an
     initial inflation above the subject's systolic pressure The measurement of
     the instant invention can alternatively be performed by stepped inflation
     from an initial sub-diastolic cuff pressure; or via continuous vis-a-vis
     discrete cuff inflation or deflation.
