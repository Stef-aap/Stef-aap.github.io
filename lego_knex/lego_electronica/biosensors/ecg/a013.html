<div style="margin-right: 20">As the heart undergoes depolarization and
repolarization, the electrical currents spread throughout the body because
the body acts as a <a href="http://www.oucom.ohiou.edu/CVPhysiology/A014.htm">volume
conductor</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>The electrical currents
generated by the heart are commonly measured by an array of electrodes
placed on the body surface and the resulting tracing is called an <a href="http://www.oucom.ohiou.edu/CVPhysiology/A009.htm">electrocardiogram</a>
(ECG, or EKG).&nbsp; (Electrical measurements can also be made within the
heart using special catheters; these are useful for specialized electrophysiological
diagnostic procedures).&nbsp; By convention, electrodes are placed on each
arm and leg, and six electrodes are placed at defined locations on the
chest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>These electrode leads are
connected to a device that measures potential differences between selected
electrodes in order to produce the characteristic electrocardiographic
tracings.&nbsp;</div>


<p style="margin-right: 20">There are two basic types of electrocardiogram
(ECG) leads: bipolar and unipolar.&nbsp; <b><a href="#bipolar">Bipolar
leads</a></b> utilize a single positive and a single negative electrode
between which electrical potentials are measured.&nbsp; <b><a href="#unipolar">Unipolar
leads</a></b> (augmented leads and chest leads) have a single positive
recording electrode and utilize a combination of the other electrodes to
serve as a composite negative electrode.

<p style="margin-right: 20"><a name="limb"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font color="#008000"><font size=+1>Limb
Leads (Bipolar)</font></font></font></b>

<p style="margin-right: 20"><img src="a013_einthovens_triangle.jpg" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=0 height=237 width=220 align=RIGHT><a name="bipolar"></a>Bipolar
recording is represented by standard limb lead configurations depicted
at the right.&nbsp; By convention, Lead I has the positive electrode on
the left arm, and the negative electrode on the right arm, and therefore
measures the potential difference between the two arms.&nbsp; In this and
the other two limb leads, an electrode on the right leg serves as a reference
electrode for recording purposes.&nbsp; In the Lead II configuration, the
positive electrode is on the left leg and the negative electrode is on
the right arm.&nbsp; Lead III has the positive electrode on the left leg
and the negative electrode on the left arm.&nbsp; These three bipolar limb
leads roughly form an equilateral triangle (with the heart at the center)
that is called Einthoven's triangle in honor of Willem Einthoven who developed
the electrocardiogram in 1901.&nbsp; Whether the limb leads are attached
to the end of the limb (wrists and ankles) or at the origin of the limb
(shoulder or upper thigh) makes no difference in the recording because
the limb can simply be viewed as a long wire conductor originating from
a point on the trunk of the body.

<p style="margin-right: 20">Based upon universally accepted <u><a href="http://www.oucom.ohiou.edu/CVPhysiology/A014.htm">ECG
rules</a></u>, a wave a depolarization heading towards the left arm will
give a positive deflection in Lead I because the positive electrode is
on the left arm.&nbsp; Maximal positive ECG deflection will occur in Lead
I when a wave of depolarization travels parallel to the axis between the
right and left arms.&nbsp; If a wave of depolarization heads away from
the left arm, the deflection will be negative.&nbsp; Also by these rules,
a wave of repolarization moving away from the left arm will be seen as
a positive deflection.&nbsp; Similar statements can be made for Leads II
and III where the positive electrode is located on the left leg.&nbsp;
For example, a wave of depolarization traveling towards the left leg will
give a positive deflection in both Leads II and III because the positive
electrode for both leads is on the left leg.&nbsp; A maximal positive deflection
will be obtained in Lead II when the depolarization wave travels parallel
to the axis between the right arm and left leg.&nbsp; Similarly, a maximal
positive deflection will be obtained in Lead II when the depolarization
wave travels parallel to the axis between the left arm and left leg.

<p style="margin-right: 20"><img src="a013_axis_reference_1.jpg" HSPACE=10 BORDER=0 height=204 width=450 align=RIGHT>If
the three limbs of Einthoven's triangle (assumed to be equilateral) are
broken apart, collapsed, and superimposed over the heart, then the positive
electrode for Lead I is said to be at zero degrees relative to the heart
(along the horizontal axis) (see figure at right).&nbsp; Similarly, the
positive electrode for Lead II will be +60&ordm; relative to the heart,
and the positive electrode for Lead III will be +120&ordm; relative to
the heart as shown to the right.&nbsp; This new construction of the electrical
axis is called the <b>axial reference system</b>.&nbsp; With this system,
a wave of depolarization traveling at +60&ordm; will produce the greatest
positive deflection in Lead II.&nbsp; A wave of depolarization oriented
+90&ordm; relative to the heart will produce equally positive deflections
in both Lead II and III.&nbsp; In this latter case, Lead I will show no
net deflection because the wave of depolarization is heading perpendicular
to the 0&ordm;, or Lead I, axis (see <a href="http://www.oucom.ohiou.edu/CVPhysiology/A014.htm">ECG
rules</a>).

<p style="margin-right: 20"><a name="augmented"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font color="#008000"><font size=+1>Augmented
Limb Leads (Unipolar)</font></font></font></b>

<p style="margin-right: 20">In addition to the three bipolar limb leads
described above, there are three augmented&nbsp;<a name="unipolar"></a>unipolar
limb leads.&nbsp; These are termed unipolar leads because there is a single
positive electrode that is referenced against a combination of the other
limb electrodes.&nbsp; The positive electrodes for these augmented leads
are located on the left arm (aV<sub>L</sub>), the right arm (aV<sub>R</sub>),
and the left leg (aV<sub>F</sub>).&nbsp; In practice, these are the same
electrodes used for Leads I, II and III.&nbsp;<img src="a013_6_lead_axial_ref.jpg" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=0 height=209 width=300 align=RIGHT>(The
ECG machine does the actual switching and rearranging of the electrode
designations).&nbsp; The three augmented leads are depicted using the axial
reference system as shown to the right.&nbsp; The aV<sub>L</sub> lead is
at -30&ordm; relative to the Lead I axis; aV<sub>R</sub> is at -150&ordm;
and aV<sub>F</sub> is at +90&ordm;.&nbsp; It is very important to learn
which lead is associated with each axis.

<p style="margin-right: 20">The three augmented unipolar leads, coupled
with the three bipolar leads, constitute the six limb leads of the ECG.&nbsp;
These leads record electrical activity along a single plane, termed the
frontal plane relative to the heart.&nbsp; Using the axial reference system
and these six leads, it is rather simple to define the direction of an
electrical vector at any given instant in time.&nbsp; If a wave of depolarization
is spreading from right-to-left along the 0&ordm; axis, then Lead I will
show the greatest positive amplitude.&nbsp; Likewise, if the direction
of the electrical vector for depolarization is directed downwards (+90&ordm;),
then aV<sub>F</sub> will show the greatest positive deflection.&nbsp; If
a wave of depolarization is moving from left-to-right at +150&ordm;, then
aV<sub>L</sub> will show the greatest <u>negative</u> deflection according
to the <u><a href="http://www.oucom.ohiou.edu/CVPhysiology/A014.htm">rules
for ECG interpretation</a></u>.

<p style="margin-right: 20"><a name="chest leads (unipolar)"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font color="#008000"><font size=+1>Chest
Leads (Unipolar)</font></font></font></b>

<p style="margin-right: 20"><img src="a013_chest_leads.jpg" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=0 height=199 width=250 align=RIGHT>The
last ECG leads to consider are the precordial, unipolar chest leads.&nbsp;
These are six positive electrodes placed on the surface of the chest over
the heart in order to record electrical activity in a plane perpendicular
to the frontal plane (see figure at right).&nbsp; These six leads are named
V<sub>1</sub> - V<sub>6</sub>.&nbsp; The rules of interpretation are the
same as for the limb leads.&nbsp; For example, a wave of depolarization
traveling towards a particular electrode on the chest surface will elicit
a positive deflection.&nbsp;

<p style="margin-right: 20">In summary, the twelve ECG leads provide different
views of the same electrical activity within the heart.&nbsp; Therefore,
the waveform recorded will be different for each lead.&nbsp; To understand
how cardiac electrical currents actually generate and ECG tracing and why
the different leads display that electrical activity differently, it is
necessary to understand <u><a href="http://www.oucom.ohiou.edu/CVPhysiology/A014.htm">volume
conductor principles and vectors</a></u>.&nbsp;
