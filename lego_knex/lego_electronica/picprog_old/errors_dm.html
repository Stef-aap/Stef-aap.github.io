<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br>tab only contains filename (without the path).
<br>This will gives problems if 2 files are opened with the same name but
a different location
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br>The list of open files under the Window menu item is duplicated.
<br>(it shows the list twice)
<br><b>I can't reproduce this error</b>
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br>The Project Overview window does not get filled in until you click
on it
<br><b>I can't reproduce this error</b>
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><b>Warning:&nbsp; if projectfile contains a section with an empty name</b>
<br>If, for some reason, the projectgroup contains an empty section, all
following sections can not be read !!
<br>(Empty section can be detected (under win98 at least), but can't be
removed, so this has to be done by an ASCII reader/writer)
<br>Probably detection of sections with empty names will give problems
under win-NT versions)

<hr WIDTH="100%"><b>1.&nbsp; Erasing a section with the name being an empty
string in a ini-file:</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; replace this:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
erasesection(old_project_name);
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by this:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If old_project_name &lt;> '' then erasesection(old_project_name);
<br>All files checked, following files were changed:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New_projectgroup.pas
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Include_tree.pas
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><b>2.&nbsp; DOS programs need short 8.3 filenames.</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; use:&nbsp; function ExtractShortPathname(const Filename:
string): string;
<br>Checked and changed:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Editor.pas,&nbsp; routine CompileIt
<br>Probably there aren't any other locations, except launching a DOS programmer.
Will be checked later.
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><b>3.&nbsp; Calling refresh_filetab in mainunit.formactivate</b>
<br>&nbsp; removed, routine "open_new_editor" now adds new filetab and
sets this filetab active
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><b>4.&nbsp; Moving the projectmanager from one panel directly to the
other panel,
</b>(also WIN98)
<br>contents of projectgroup and libraries disappeared. Problem was caused
by the fact that inbetween the mainform became active.
<br>Changed
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mainunit.formactivate (now filling of lists only
done the first time)
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><b>5.&nbsp; Add a project with a blank path give an error </b>(also
WIN98)
<br>Changed
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Line 108 of New_Project_groupfrom:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (ShowModal = mrOK) and (edit_prog_path.text &lt;>
'') then
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><b>6.&nbsp; If the jal-file was in a very long path, DOS-line became
too long
</b>(also WIN98)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The full path to the JAL file does not need to be
included in the command line,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; because you have changed to the directory where
the JAL file resides.
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><b>7. Doubleclick on the treeview of a project could generate exceptions,</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if TreeView1.Selected = nil then Exit;&nbsp;&nbsp;
// added to correct error
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><b>8. It may be better to pre-select the main JAL file after any changes.</b>
