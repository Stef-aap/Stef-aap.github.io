<td ALIGN=LEFT COLSPAN="2">Because the connector can mounted in several
positions, you never know where the positive supply is. Therefore you have
to use some kind of diode principle. Looking on the internet I found 2
principles, from which the FET design I liked the most.</td>

<td>The most simple and often seen manner to create ground is displayed
in the schematic on the left. You can use every small signal diode.
<p>The main disadvantage of this circuit is that depending on the current
drawn, the voltage across the diodes varies. Because of that, most sensors
will behave in a non-linear way, specially if a large range is required.
<p>For simple (not too accurate) sensors this is a perfect solution.</td>

<td>By using 2 N-channel FETs, which behave as a fixed resistor as low
as 0.1 Ohm, you get a real hard ground (nearly independant of the current)
and therfor a very linear sensor behaviour over a wide range.
<br>I found this principle at <a href="http://home.flash.net/~sevcik/index.html">Techno-Stuff.</a>
<p>The design is quiet strange, because the source and drain of the FETs
is exchanged (drain should be more positive than source). If you have a
theoretical FET this would be no problem. In practice the drain of a FET
is far more better isolated, and thus can handle higher voltages. At these
low voltages in practice there's still no problem.
<br>IN FACT, putting the FETs the other way around, doesn't work at all,
due to the anti-parallel protection diode within the FET's it will cause
a short cirquit.
<p>This design is a little more expensive and it als takes a bit more space.</td>

<td COLSPAN="2">Creating the positive supply is more simpel, because 5
Volt is the maximum voltage the AD-converter of the RCX can measure.
<br>Some people think that applying more than 5 Volt will damage the AD-converter
(specification says it will accept 5 Volt + 0.3 Volt as a absolute maximum
rating), but by selecting a light sensor you will also drive the (external)
RCX terminals by 7.. 8 Volt. Conclusion: there must be a protection network
between the RCX terminals and the AD-converter.</td>

<td>The capacitor value is often taken too large, which takes up too much
space.
<p>If you calculate the necessairy value, you get the following formulas
for the capacitance per unit of current drawn:
<br>if you allow 5% power supply current:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C = 0.3 uF/mA
<br>if you allow 1% power supply current:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C = 1.4 uF/mA
<p>So if you draw 5 mA current, 10uF will always be enough.</td>

<td>The lego / mindstorms community is very creative, so it's hard to come
up with a new idea, but here is one I think.
<p>Combining the creation of the positive power supply and the signal path,
you can save 1 diode.</td>

<p>The sensor inputs of the RCX are in fact current sensing inputs. Driving
such an input with a voltage source is a bad habit. You'll have to add
a series resistor to limit the current drawn in cases the sensor is hard
pulled up to +7Volt. This will result in a non-linearity and above excessive
energy is lost (normally during 95% of the time the +7V is present).

<p>This drive cirquit has several advantages over the commonly used voltage-driven
cirquit.
<ul>
<li>
it's far more linear (see purple curve below)</li>

<li>
it consumes less power (the sense current will never exceed the 0.5 mA,
regardless of the power supply)</li>

<li>
offset is not affected by diode-drop, so indepent of the current drawn
by the rest of the electronics of the sensor cirquit.</li>
</ul>
With R2/R3 the gain of the input can be adjusted. At the junction of R2-R3
the full range of the RCX is reached with 0 ... 50 mV.</td>

<td>This idea was also found at <a href="http://home.flash.net/~sevcik/index.html">Techno-Stuff</a>.
<br>It has one component less than the standard schematic and above it's
more linear than the standard schematic. Depending on the polarity of the
RCX terminals only R1 or R2 is used to generate the sense-signal.
<br>The drawback of this is that some extra current is lost from the output
of the opamp through the other resistor to ground.</td>
