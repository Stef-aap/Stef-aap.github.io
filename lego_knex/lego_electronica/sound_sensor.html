<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This was our first project, to test our
knowledge of the electronics of the RCX and to get a feeling of how to
put the components into a lego brick. For convenience we used standard
components and no smd-components.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We designed it straight forward and of
course this leads almost exact to the&nbsp; <a href="http://www.plazaearth.com/usr/gasperi/sound.htm">design
of Michael Gasperi.</a> His design was also published (without reference)
in a Dutch magazine, Elektuur july/august 2000, schematic 30. Of course
this is not a clean electronic design, but more "getting maximum functionality
from a minimal number of components".</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have tried to optimize the design (see
schematic below), which resulted in the following differences with respect
to&nbsp; the design of Michael Gasperi:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">we used an electret microphone, which is much
smaller and has a higher sensitivity</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">the power supply capacitor C3 is much smaller,
even with 1uF the sensor works perfect (see <a href="designing_sensors.html#creating positive supply">my
arguments</a>)</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">we saved 1 diode, by combining the creation
of the positive power supply and generating the output signal</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">we amplified the signal extra with U1B (5*),
one of the resistors R6 or R7 is mounted in way it can easily be changed</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">we increased the value of R8, saving a lot
of energy (minus 5 mA).</font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">This sensor uses less than 1.5 mA of current,
which can even be reduced by a factor 2 by using a TLC272 (CMOS opamp)
instead of the LM358.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The RC-time of C2/R5 seems to be optimal,
we've tried other values but they performed worse.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Increasing R8 from 1 kOhm to 10 kOhm gives
a great reduction of power needs. This is quit simpel to understand, if
you assume that most of the time there is no sound, then output 7 of U1
will be 0 Volt. The RCX drives its terminals 97% of the time (hard) to
+8 Volt (see <a href="rcx_inside.html">measurements</a>). So the power consumption
of R8 will be roughly 8 Volt / R8, which in the case of 1 kOhm is 8 mA.
There is a little drawback, the effective signal range is only 2.5V ...
5V, instead of 0.5 V ... 5V. Because the amplifier isn't linear at all,
and even has a memory effect, the decreased range doesn't affect the performance
of the cirquit.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Combining the positive power supply and
the signal generation, results in a power supply for the opamp which is
0.7 Volt less than normally. This is no problem because the opamps will
work correctly downto 3 Volt, it will even save some (very little) current.</font>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It was a hard job to get the last 5 components
in it.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Because the electronics just fits in the
height we have to mount a 1/3 height plate as a bottom cover (this wasn't
planned).</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The largest mistake we made, was the use
of the wrong resistor type. We used 0.25 Watt metal film resistors, in
the future we will use 0.125 Watt carbon film resistors, these are the
smallest resistor components normally available.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Another improvment may be the use of smd-ic's,
which still can be handled without the use of a printed cirquit board.</font></td>
