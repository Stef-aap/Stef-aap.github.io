<P>You can't highlight and remove the Device Manager categories, and you</P>
<P>can only remove one device at a time, at which point the category</P>
<P>collapses again.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>1. Click on + next to USB section. Select first item under it, Remove.</P>
<P>2. Repeat until the category itself disappears (meaning there are no</P>
<P>longer any devices listed there.)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Bu *sure* to do this in Safe Mode. It's just as safe in Normal Mode, but</P>
<P>in Normal Mode all you see is devices that have been loaded, whereas in</P>
<P>Safe Mode you see all installations. This is an important distinction,</P>
<P>since one of the main reasons for doing this procedure is to get rid of</P>
<P>"ghost" devices--devices that have been installed but are no longer</P>
<P>present, or devices which have been installed two or three times but</P>
<P>only one instance loads.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Really, except for the Video card, this procedure is pretty safe. Video</P>
<P>devices should not be removed this way except in extremis (and I</P>
<P>wouldn't recommend it for any novice.) Only other consideration is that</P>
<P>devices aren't usually stand-alone. You install many devices "onto"</P>
<P>other devices. This is where we get the terms "Parent" and "Child"</P>
<P>devices. More in-depth usage of this procedure involves remembering to</P>
<P>reinstall any Child device of any Parent device that you reinstall. Even</P>
<P>that isn't a hard rule, and the whole thing is pretty forgiving. Might</P>
<P>not fix your problem, but it seldom creates others.</P>
